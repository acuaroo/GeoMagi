Technical Report, National Centers for Environmental Information, NOAA. doi: 10.25923/ytk1-yx35 \rABSTRACT \r \rThis report contains a complete description of the World Magnetic Model (WMM) 2020. Section 
1 contains information that users of WMM2020 require in order to implement the model and software in navigation and heading systems, and to understand magnetic charts, poles and geomagnetic coordinate 
systems. Section 2 contains a detailed summary of the data used and the modeling techniques employed. Section 3 contains an assessment of the model uncertainties and a description of the error model provided 
with the WMM2020. Section 4 contains charts of all the magnetic elements at 2020.0 and their expected annual rates of change between 2020.0 and 2025.0. These predicted changes are based upon the best knowledge 
of the geomagnetic main field evolution at the time the WMM was released. \r \rSponsored by the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the U.K. Defence Geographic Centre (DGC), the World 
Magnetic Model (WMM) is produced by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration�s National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA/NCEI) and the British Geological Survey (BGS). It is 
the standard model used by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the U.K. Ministry of Defence, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), for navigation, 
attitude and heading referencing systems using the geomagnetic field. It is also used widely in civilian navigation and heading systems. \r \rThe WMM2020 product release includes several software items 
by which the WMM2020 model may be computed and/or its subroutines incorporated into larger DoD systems. It is hoped that the software provided is useful for most occasions of DoD systems procurement and 
development. \r \r \rThe model, associated software, digital charts and documentation are available at https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/ or by contacting NCEI, BGS, or NGA.  Please cite using these

field has a more or less well-known direction, which can be used to orient ships, aircraft, satellites, antennas, drilling equipment and handheld devices. At some places on the globe the horizontal direction 
of the magnetic field coincides with the direction of geographic north (�true� north), but in general this is not the case. The angular amount by which the horizontal direction of the magnetic field differs 
from true north is called the magnetic declination, or simply declination (D, see Figure 1). This is the correction required to convert between a magnetic bearing and a true bearing. The main utility of 
the World Magnetic Model (WMM) is to provide magnetic declination for any desired location on the globe. In addition to the magnetic declination, the WMM also provides the complete geometry of the field 
from 1 km below the World Geodetic System (WGS 84) ellipsoid surface to approximately 850 km above it (MIL-PRF-89500B, Department of Defense, 2019). The magnetic field extends deep into the Earth and far 
out into space, but the WMM is not valid at these extremes.  The Earth�s magnetism has several sources. All sources affect a scientific or navigational instrument but only some are represented in the WMM. 
The strongest contribution, by far, is the magnetic field produced by the Earth�s liquid-iron outer core, called the �core field�. Magnetic minerals in the crust and upper mantle make a further contribution 
that can be locally significant. Electric currents induced by the flow of conducting sea water through the ambient magnetic field make a further, albeit weak, contribution to the observed magnetic field. 
All of these are of �internal� origin and their large-scale components (see below) are included in the WMM. Deliberately excluded from the WMM by the data selection process and by other means (e.g., model 
co-estimation) are so-called �disturbance fields�. These are contributions arising from electric currents in the upper atmosphere and near-Earth space. These �external� magnetic fields are time-varying, 
and have a further effect. They induce electric currents in the Earth and oceans, producing secondary internal magnetic fields, which are considered part of the disturbance field and are not represented 
in the WMM.  \rThe mathematical representation of the WMM is an expansion of the magnetic potential into spherical harmonic functions to degree and order 12. The minimum wavelength resolved is  360� / 
�12.13   = 28.8� in arc-length, corresponding to 3200 km at the Earth�s surface (see section 3.6.3 of Backus et al., 1996). The WMM is a model of those internal magnetic fields that are not part of the 
disturbance field and have spatial wavelengths exceeding 30� in arc-length. This works out to be almost the entire core field and the long-wavelength portion of the crustal and oceanic fields. In this 
report, the term �main field� refers to the portion of the Earth�s magnetic field at epoch 2020.0 that is modeled by the WMM. \r\rThe core field changes perceptibly from year to year. This effect, called 
secular variation (SV), is accounted for in the WMM by a linear SV model. Specifically, a straight line is used as the model of the time-dependence of each coefficient of the spherical harmonic representation 
of the magnetic potential (see section 1.2). Due to unpredictable non-linear changes in the core field, the values of the WMM coefficients have to be updated every five years. The revision described in 
this report, WMM2020, is valid from 2020.0 to 2025.0. \r\r1.1.1 MAGNETIC ELEMENTS \r\rThe geomagnetic field vector, Bm, is described by seven elements. These are the northerly intensity X, the easterly 
intensity Y, the vertical intensity Z (positive downwards) and the following quantities derived from X, Y and Z: the horizontal intensity H, the total intensity F, the inclination angle I, (also called 
the dip angle and measured from the horizontal plane to the field vector, positive downwards) and the declination angle D (also called the magnetic variation and measured clockwise from true north to the 
horizontal component of the field vector). In the descriptions of X, Y, Z, H, F, I and D above, the vertical direction is perpendicular to the WGS 84 ellipsoid model of the Earth, the horizontal plane 
is perpendicular to the vertical direction, and the rotational directions clockwise and counter-clockwise are determined by a view from above (see Figure 1). \r\rFigure 1: The seven elements of the geomagnetic 
field vector Bm associated with an arbitrary point in space.\r\rThe quantities X, Y and Z are the sizes of perpendicular vectors that add vectorially to Bm.  Conversely, X, Y and Z can be determined from 
the quantities F, I and D (i.e., the quantities that specify the size and direction of Bm). \r\r\rIn the polar regions, or near the rotation axis of the Earth, the angle D changes strongly with a change 
in the longitude of the observer, and is therefore a poor measure of the direction of Bm. For this reason, the WMM specification (MIL-PRF-89500B, Department of Defense, 2019) defines two \rDiagram of the 
relative orientation of the magnetic field vectors\rauxiliary angles, called grid variation north (GVN) and south (GVS), for the direction of Bm in the horizontal plane in each polar region. Their definitions 
are: \r \r\r............=.........   for ....>55�  (1) ............=....+....   for ....<.55� \rwhere .... is the longitude and .... is the geodetic latitude.  \r \rThe quantities GVN and GVS defined above 
are examples of a more general concept, namely grid variation (also called grid magnetic angle or grivation). At a location on the plane of a chosen horizontal grid coordinate system, grivation is the 
angle between grid north and magnetic north, i.e., the angle measured clockwise from the direction parallel to the grid�s Northing axis to the horizontal component of the magnetic field at the observer�s 
location. Grivation is useful for local surveys, where location is given by grid coordinates rather than by longitude and latitude. It is dependent on the map projection used to define the grid coordinates. 
In general, it is \r \r\r ........................=.........  (2) \rwhere D is the magnetic declination and C is the �convergence-of-meridians� defined as the clockwise angle from the northward meridional 
arc to the grid Northing direction. \r \rFor example, large scale military topographic mapping routinely employs the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid coordinates for the map projection of the sheet, 
for the definition of a grid to overprint, and for a grivation calculation as defined above. Above 84�N and below 80�S, it employs the Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) grid. For these two grids, the 
grid variation could be notated GVUTM and GVUPS, respectively.  \r \rIn the WMM subroutine library, both GVUPS and GVUTM are provided within certain restrictions (see the software user�s guide, https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml). 
\r \r1.1.3 RANGE OF THE MAGNETIC ELEMENTS AT THE EARTH�S SURFACE \r \rTable 1 shows the expected range of the magnetic field elements and GV at the Earth�s surface. \r \rTable 1: Ranges of magnetic elements 
and GV at the Earth's surface. \rRange at Earth�s Surface Alternative  Positive Element Name Name Sense Min Max Unit X North component Northerly intensity -17000 43000 nT North East Y Z H East component 
Easterly intensity -18000 \r1.2 RELEVANT MODEL EQUATIONS \r This section describes the representation of the magnetic field in the WMM and lists the equations needed to obtain the magnetic field elements 
for the desired location and time from the WMM coefficients. All variables in this section adhere to the following measurement conventions: angles are in radians, lengths are in meters, magnetic intensities 
are in nanoteslas (nT, where one tesla is one weber per square meter or one kg.s-2.A-1) and times are in years. The software may display these quantities in other units, which it will identify.  The main 
magnetic field Bm is a potential field and therefore can be written in geocentric spherical coordinates (longitude ...., latitude ....., radius ....) as the negative spatial gradient of a scalar potential 
  ........(....,.....,....,....)=......(....,.....,....,....)  (3) where .... is the time. This potential can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics: \r................+1....(....,.....,....,....)=........(............(....)cos(........)+.........(....)sin(........)).............(sin.....) 
........=1....=0(4) \rwhere N=12 is the degree of the expansion of the WMM, .... (6371200 m) is the geomagnetic reference radius (which is close to the mean Earth radius), (....,.....,....) are the longitude, 
latitude and radius in a spherical geocentric reference frame, and ............(....) and .........(....) are the time-dependent Gauss coefficients of degree n and order m describing the Earth�s main magnetic 
field. For any real number ...., .............(....) are the Schmidt semi-normalized associated Legendre functions defined as: \rHere, the definition of ........,....(....) is commonly used in geodesy 
and geomagnetism (e.g., Heiskanen and Moritz, 1967, equation 1-60; Langel, 1987, equation 8). Sample functions, for geocentric latitude ....., are: \r \r  \r\r \r\r \r\r \r\r (6) \r\r\r \r\r   \rThese 
........,....(....) are related to the ............(....) defined in Abramowitz and Stegun (1972, Chapter 8) or Gradshteyn and Ryzhik (1994, Chapter 8.7) by ........,....(....)=(.1)................(....). 
 \r \rWMM2020 comprises two sets of Gauss coefficients to degree and order N=12. One set provides a spherical harmonic main field model for 2020.0 in units of nT, the other set provides a predictive secular 
variation model for the period 2020.0 to 2025.0 in units of nT/year. The secular variation model was derived from geomagnetic data prior to 2020.0. Specifically, it is the average of two models: one representing 
the average change of the main field over a year starting at 2018.5; the other representing the extrapolated change of the main field in 2020.0. However, this represents our best knowledge of the geomagnetic 
main field evolution at the time of the WMM release, and is expected to yield geomagnetic main field values within defined uncertainty parameters for the lifetime of the model. \r \rA step by step procedure 
is provided below for computing the magnetic field elements at a given location and time (., ., hMSL, t), where . and . are the longitude and geodetic latitude, hMSL is height above Mean Sea Level (MSL), 
and t is the time given in decimal years. \r \rIn the first step, the user provides the time, location and height above MSL at which the magnetic elements are to be calculated. The height above MSL is 
then converted to height h above the WGS 84 ellipsoid by using the geopotential model EGM96 (Lemoine et al., 1998). This is accomplished by interpolating a grid of the geoid height file with a spatial 
resolution of 15 arc-minutes. This stage of converting height above MSL to height above the WGS 84 ellipsoid has a very small effect on the resulting magnetic field values (of the order of 1 nT or less) 
and is unnecessary in the majority of implementations. Note that the user can also directly enter the height above the WGS 84 ellipsoid into the software. \r \rThe geodetic coordinates (., ., h) are then 
transformed into spherical geocentric coordinates (., .�, r) by recognizing that . is the same in both coordinate systems, and that (.�, r) is computed from (., h) according to the equations: \r \r  \r\r 
\r\r \r\r (7) \r\r\r \r\rHere, ....=.....2+....2, where x, y and z are the coordinates of a geocentric Cartesian coordinate system in which the positive x and z axes point in the directions of the prime 
meridian (.=0) and the Earth�s rotation axis, respectively. The semi-major axis A, reciprocal flattening 1/f, eccentricity squared e2 and radius of curvature of the prime vertical (also called normal section) 
Rc at the given latitude . are given for the WGS 84 ellipsoid as \r \r\r \rIn the second step, the Gauss coefficients ............(....) and .........(....) are determined for the desired time t from the 
model coefficients ............(....0), .........(....0), ........(....0) and ........(....0) as \rwhere the time is given in decimal years and ....0=2020.0, the reference epoch of the model. The quantities 
............(....0) and .........(....0) are called the main field coefficients and the quantities ........(....0) and ........(....0) are called the secular variation coefficients. \r \rIn the third step, 
the field vector components X�, Y� and Z� in geocentric coordinates are computed as \r1�VX'(.,.',r)=.�.  r'n+2. (10) �12.a.�nmmdPm(sin.')=...(gn(t)cosm.+hn(t)sinm.)nn=1.r.m=0d.'1�VY'(.,.',r)=.rcos.'�.

(16) \rIn the fourth step, the geocentric magnetic field vector components X�, Y� and Z�, are rotated into the ellipsoidal reference frame, using \r)cos(')sin('')sin(')cos('.........=ZXX......+..==ZXZYY 
  \r\r \r\r(17) \rSimilarly, the time derivatives of the vector components, ., . and . are rotated using \r)cos(')sin('')sin(')cos('..........+..==.....=ZXZYYZXX........  \r \r\r \r\r(18) \rIn the last 
step, the magnetic elements H, F, I and D are computed from the orthogonal components: \r \r ),arctan(),,arctan(,,2222XYDHZIZHFYXH==+=+= \r (19) \r\r\r \r\rwhere arctan(....,....) is tan.1(..../....), 
taking into account the angular quadrant, avoiding a division by zero, and resulting in a declination in the range of -� to � and an inclination in the range of -�/2 to �/2. These angles in radians are 
then output by the WMM software in degrees. \rThe secular variation of these elements is computed using \rHYYXXH....+.=FZZYYXXF.....+.+.=DVGHXYYXDFHZZHI........=...=...=22(20) \r \rwhere ,  and ......... 
are given in radians per year. The WMM software then outputs these angles in arc-minutes per year or decimal degrees per year. \r1.3 THE WMM2020 COEFFICIENTS \rThe model coefficients, also referred to 
as Gauss coefficients, are listed in Table 2. These coefficients can be used to compute values for the field elements and their annual rates of change at any location near the surface of the Earth, and 
at any date between 2020.0 and 2025.0.  \rTable 2: Final coefficients for WMM2020. Units are nT for the main field, and nT per year for the secular variation. The index n is the degree and m is the order. 
Since ............(........) and .............(........) are not defined for ....=...., the corresponding fields are left blank. (The corresponding coefficients are set to zero in the WMM2020 coefficient

not a geophysical phenomenon, stemming from the ambiguity of longitude at a Pole and at any altitude over a Pole. Related to this, the North-East-Down (NED) frame of unit vectors to which the X., Y., Z. 
quantities are referred is defined everywhere except at or over a Pole. This section extends these concepts. The North Pole is discussed in the following, with similar implications for the South Pole. 
\r \rTo most comprehensively appreciate the model equations, let the arbitrariness of the North Pole�s longitude disambiguate the North Pole�s NED frame. In other words, if the Pole is assigned a longitude 
of ., then the NED frame at the Pole is to be oriented so that the unit vector �N� of NED has the same direction as for a point approaching the pole along the .-meridian, the unit vector �D� is directed 
downward, and the unit vector �E� is directed so that NED is right-handed. This is equivalent to requiring the NED frame at longitude . and latitude 90� to be the limit of NED frames as the latitude approaches 
90� and the longitude and altitude remain fixed. \r \rOn 1 January 2020, directly above the North (resp. South) Pole at 6,371,200 meters from the Earth�s center, the magnetic field vector lies in the half-plane 
of the 176.68�W (resp. 30.83�W) meridian. If the Pole is assigned ....=0�, the components X., Y., Z. (also the components X, Y, Z) are 1797.7 nT, 104.3 nT, and 56386.7 nT respectively at the North Pole, 
14276.5 nT, -8520.4 nT and -51671.3 nT respectively at the South Pole. A change in the longitude assigned to the Pole is equivalent to a rotation of the NED frame about the polar axis. \r \rThe model equations 
of section 1.2 support the above pole calculation and others like it provided the equation for Y. is extended by continuity as follows to ameliorate the factor cos(.....) in the denominator. As ..... approaches 
90�, the function (.............(sin.....))/cos..... approaches zero if ....>1. It approaches certain non-zero finite limits if ....=1. It multiplies a zero coefficient and can be ignored if ....=0. For 
....=1 and 1�....�12 respectively, the limits are: \r \r1 \r 2 \r 3 \r 4 \r 5 \r 6 \r 7 \r 8 \r 9 \r 10 \r 11 \r 12 \r \r1 \r  \r\r  \r\r  \r\r  \r\r  \r\r  \r\r  \r\r  \r\r  \r\r  \r\r  \r\r \r\r1.5 MODEL 
EQUATIONS NUMERICAL EXAMPLE \r \rA software implementation of the relevant model equations is provided with this report. Most software developers should find the C programs and/or C subroutines to be sufficient 
for their purposes, after adaptations are made to their own software structures. \r \rTo aid software developers who need to re-implement the model equations for special requirements, Tables 3a to 3c provide 
a numerical example showing the intermediate calculations of section 1.2. For the purpose of verifying the correct implementation of the equations, the tables display many more digits than are warranted 
by the accuracy of the WMM.  \r \rThe output in Table 3c includes grivation calculations for four grid systems, whether or not the grid system is commonly used in that part of the world. This is helpful 
for the purposes of verifying correct implementation of the mathematics in the software, and if not used the unwanted grid systems may be ignored. \r \r \rTable 3a: High-precision numerical example, given

magnetic poles. The most common understanding is that they are the positions on the Earth's surface where the geomagnetic field is perpendicular to the ellipsoid, that is, vertical (assuming the deflection 
of the vertical is negligible). These positions are called dip poles, and the north and south dip poles do not have to be (and are not now) antipodal. In principle the dip poles can be found by experiment, 
conducting a magnetic survey to determine where the field is vertical (Newitt et al., 2009). In practice the geomagnetic field is vertical on oval-shaped loci traced on a daily basis, with considerable 
variation from one day to the next. \r \rOther magnetic pole definitions originate from models of the geomagnetic field (Table 4). The WMM representation of the field includes a magnetic dipole at the 
center of the Earth. This dipole defines an axis that intersects the Earth's surface at two antipodal points. These points are called geomagnetic poles. The geomagnetic poles, otherwise known as the dipole 
poles, can be computed from the first three Gauss coefficients of the WMM. Based on the WMM2020 coefficients for 2020.0 the geomagnetic north pole is at 72.68�W longitude and 80.59�N geocentric latitude 
(80.65�N geodetic latitude), and the geomagnetic south pole is at 107.32�E longitude and 80.59�S geocentric latitude (80.65�S geodetic latitude). The axis of the dipole is currently inclined at 9.41� to 
the Earth's rotation axis. The same dipole is the basis for the simple geomagnetic coordinate system of geomagnetic latitude and longitude (see section 4, Geomagnetic longitude and latitude in Mercator 
projection). The geomagnetic equator is at geomagnetic latitude 0�. \r \rThe WMM can also be used to calculate dip pole positions. These model dip poles are computed from all the Gauss coefficients using 
an iterative method. In 2020.0 the north dip pole computed from WMM2020 is located at longitude 164.04�E and geodetic latitude 86.50�N and the south dip pole at longitude 135.88�E and geodetic latitude 
64.07�S. Past, current and future dip pole positions are available at https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/GeomagneticPoles.shtml and https://geomag.bgs.ac.uk/education/poles.html. Over the next five years, 
the WMM2020 predicts a very slow drift of the south dip pole, at about 9 km/year on average, and a faster (yet gradually decelerating) drift of the north dip pole, at about 41 km/year. \r \rScientists, 
map makers and polar explorers have an interest in the dip and geomagnetic pole locations. Although geomagnetic pole observations cannot be made to indicate their positions, these poles are arguably of 
greater significance than the dip poles. Auroral ovals, which are approximately 5� latitude bands where aurorae are likely to be seen, are approximately centered on the geomagnetic poles. They are usually 
displaced slightly to the night-side of the geomagnetic poles and greatly vary in size: bands of greatest activity occur between 15� and 25� from the geomagnetic poles. \r \rA further concept is that of 
eccentric dipole, or off-centered dipole. The location of the center of the eccentric dipole (sometimes known as magnetic center), computed using the first eight Gauss coefficients for 2020.0 (Langel, 
1987, p. 386), is at (r, .�, .) = (591 kilometers, 22.67�N, 136.97�E). The axis of the eccentric dipole is parallel to the axis of the (centered) dipole field. \r \rTable 4: Computed pole positions based

better guidance to navigators and users, a new product has been created for WMM2020 called the �Blackout Zone� (BoZ). BoZs are generated for, both, the north and south magnetic poles. The BoZs provide 
improved geographic delineation to navigators as to where they can trust their compass. In the Blackout Zone, WMM declination values are not accurate and compasses are not to be trusted. In addition, BoZ 
Caution Zones surround the BoZs to alert navigators of increasingly unreliable compass accuracy (see Figure 2). Requirements for the BoZs are described in MIL-PRF-89500B (Department of Defense, 2019). 
\r \rPreviously, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Safety of Navigation (SoN) guidance included the following warning on all polar maps and charts (Defense Mapping Agency, 1981):  \r�The compass 
becomes increasingly unreliable approaching the magnetic pole from a distance of approximately 1000 miles�.  \rSince the magnetic poles move significantly over time and paper products may not be updated 
to reflect this information, the warning was stamped on all maps and charts that covered areas within 1000 miles of the geographic poles (see Figure 2). With the prevalence of easily updatable digital 
maps, DoD has taken steps to provide the new BoZs for polar SoN. \r \rCompass needles align with the horizontal magnetic field lines allowing users to see where magnetic north is from their current location. 
Over most of the globe, the magnetic field lines are near parallel to the Earth�s surface. However, at the magnetic poles the magnetic field lines are vertical, which is why a compass will not work well. 
The needle in the compass will want to point vertically and the result is a spinning needle. The BoZs are calculated to cover regions of the Earth where the horizontal component of the magnetic field is 
significantly weaker than the vertical component of the magnetic field. \r \rSpecifically, the BoZs are defined as constantly moving regions of the WGS 84 ellipsoid where the horizontal intensity (H) is 
less than 2000 nT. Each BoZ is surrounded by a Caution Zone where the horizontal intensity is less than 6000 nT. The BoZ regions are provided to users in the form of shapefiles available at ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/wmm/wmm2020/shapefiles/, 
and are plotted on some maps for visualization purposes (see section 1.10). In addition, both NGA \rproducts and the online calculators provided by NCEI include warnings to navigators approaching the BoZs.

in this region.� [triggered if ....<2000 nT] \r�Caution: location is approaching the blackout zone around the magnetic pole as defined by the WMM military specification (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/data/MIL-PRF-89500B.pdf). 
Compass accuracy may be degraded in this region.� [triggered if ....�2000 nT and ....<6000 nT] \r \rNGA Warning: �This location is, either approaching or within the magnetic blackout zone defined by the 
World Magnetic Model (WMM) military specification, MIL-PRF-89500B. Compass accuracy is increasingly unreliable approaching the blackout zone where declination errors exceed 1 degree; and highly degraded 
within the blackout zone where declination errors of up to 180 degrees will occur. The large declination errors are a result of weak horizontal magnetic intensity and proximity of the magnetic pole.� \r 
\rThere are two important facts to note regarding the new BoZs that must be understood before implementation in navigation systems. First, the BoZs will move over time with the magnetic poles. WMM2020 
provides the location of the BoZs until December 2024 and it will be the user�s responsibility to utilize the correct BoZ for the current time. \r \rThe second important fact to note is that the BoZs denote 
regions where compass reliability gets increasingly worse, not hard limits on where a compass cannot be used. In other words, the compass will not work perfectly 1 meter outside the BoZ and fail 1 meter 
within. The Caution Zone provides a buffer to assist navigators in this regard. \r \rFigure 2 and Table 5 show the refinement of the BoZs compared against legacy paper map guidance. For the Arctic Region, 
the area of unreliability is reduced by over 6 million square kilometers and the area of caution is reduced by over 14 million square kilometers. The Antarctic Region reduces the area of unreliability 
and area of caution significantly more, and more appropriately portrays the warning zone near the magnetic pole not the geographic pole. \r \rTable 5: BoZ size reduction against legacy warning zones. All

and other systems. Also included with the model is software for computing the magnetic field components X, Y, Z, H, F, I, D and auxiliary angles GVN and GVS as defined above, as well as the blackout zone 
products and the model uncertainty on each component (see section 3). WMM2020 is to be used from 1 January 2020, to 31 December 2024. In December of 2024, barring unforeseen circumstances, the U.S. and 
U.K. agencies will replace WMM2020 with a new degree and order 12 main field model, and a new degree and order 12 predictive secular-variation model. \r\r\r1.9 POLICY ON ALTERNATE SOFTWARE FOR THE U.S. 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \r\rThe WMM2020 product release includes several software items by which the WMM2020 model may be computed and/or its subroutines incorporated into larger U.S. Department of Defense 
(DoD) systems. It is hoped that the software provided is useful for most occasions of DoD systems procurement and development. \r\rIf there are special requirements, and the model equations must be implemented 
anew or a separate interpolation algorithm invented, the software developer may use the label WMM2020 for the resulting product provided the resulting software agrees with the relevant model equations 
within the following tolerances: \rBetween latitudes 89.992�S and 89.992�N, \rQuantities in nanotesla (nT) shall be correct to within 0.1 nT \rQuantities in nanotesla (nT) per year shall be correct to 
within 0.1 nT/year \r(see section 1.4 for the computation problems exactly at the Poles). \r\rThis policy is designed to promote interoperability and to track departures from consistency when necessary. 
It permits systems developers to display as many digits as needed and not display unneeded digits. It also allows that the computations be taken to less than full double precision accuracy and the software 
retain the WMM2020 label. This policy refers to the allowed computational error in the software, not to the accuracy or limitations of the science or the geomagnetic model. \r\rIf there are special requirements, 
and the model equations are implemented anew or separate interpolation algorithm invented, and accuracy is sacrificed for speed of computation such that the above tolerances are not met, the label WMM2020 
may not be applied to the resulting product. In this situation, the DoD entity or contractor is urged to apply to NGA or NCEI acting on behalf of NGA, for the label to adopt to indicate that this is a

FIELD \r\rThe Earth�s magnetic field (B) is a vector quantity varying in space (r) and time (t). The field, as measured by a magnetic sensor on or above the Earth�s surface, is actually a composite of 
several magnetic field contributions, generated by a variety of sources. These fields are superimposed and the sources and fields interact through inductive processes with each other. The most important 
of these geomagnetic sources are: \r�Core field, Bcore, generated in Earth�s conducting, fluid outer core;\r\r�Crustal field, Bcrust, from Earth�s crust/upper mantle;\r\r�Combined disturbance field, Bdisturbance, 
from electrical currents flowing in the upperatmosphere and magnetosphere, which also induce electrical currents in the sea and theground\r\r\rThe observed magnetic field is a sum of contributions: \r\r 
B(r, t) = Bcore(r, t) + Bcrust(r) + Bdisturbance(r, t) \r (21) \r\r\r \r\rBcore dominates the field, accounting for over 95% of the field strength at the Earth�s surface. Secular variation is the slow 
change in time of Bcore. The field arising from magnetized crustal rocks, Bcrust, varies spatially, but is nearly constant for the time-scales considered here. In most locations Bcrust is much smaller 
in magnitude than Bcore but can have significant local impact on magnetic compass devices. The field arising from currents flowing in the ionosphere and magnetosphere and their resultant induced currents 
in the Earth�s mantle and crust, Bdisturbance, varies both with location and time.  \r\rBcrust has spatial variations on the order of meters to thousands of kilometers and cannot be fully modeled with 
low degree spherical harmonic models. Therefore, the WMM does not include contributions from the crust except for those of very long wavelength. Bcrust is usually smaller at sea than on land, and decreases 
with increasing altitude (like the core field, but much more rapidly as its sources are near the Earth�s surface and its power encompasses a wide range of \rspatial scales). The rock magnetization resulting 
in Bcrust may be either induced by the core field or remnant from the time of formation, or be a combination of both. \r\rFigure 3 shows the various current systems flowing in the magnetosphere. The disturbance 
field can vary regularly, with fundamental periods of one day and one year, as well as irregularly on time scales of seconds to days. The regular variations are both diurnal and annual, and are essentially 
generated by the daylit atmosphere at altitudes of 100-130 kilometers, ionized by the Sun�s radiation and, moved in the Earth�s magnetic field by winds and tides, thus producing the necessary conditions 
(motion of a conductor in a magnetic field) for a dynamo to operate. Further daily and annual variations are caused by the rotation of the Earth in the magnetospheric field, which is approximately fixed 
in orientation relative to the Sun. The irregular variations in the disturbance field are due to magnetic storms and sub-storms. Magnetic storms generally have three phases: an initial phase, often with 
a sudden commencement and increased horizontal field at mid-latitudes; a main phase; and a recovery phase. The main phase involves an intensification of the ring current (Figure 3) from the plasma sheet. 
 \r\rDiagram of the current systems of Earth's magnetosphere\rFigure 3: Current systems of the magnetosphere  \r\rDuring the recovery phase the ring current returns to normal over a number of days and 
associated sub-storms subside. Magnetic storm and sub-storm effects are generally more severe at high geomagnetic latitudes where the ionized region of the upper atmosphere (i.e., the ionosphere) is coupled 
to the magnetosphere by field-aligned currents. They are therefore strongly influenced by the interplanetary magnetic field and current systems in the magnetotail. Both the regular and irregular disturbance 
field variations are modulated by season and the solar magnetic activity cycle. The primary disturbance field is often known as the external field, as its main sources, the ionosphere and magnetosphere, 
are external to the surface of the Earth where geomagnetic measurements have been traditionally observed. However, this term can be confusing when using satellite data, as the ionospheric dynamo region 
(100-130 kilometers) is below satellite altitude and therefore effectively internal to the orbital region. For further information about the crustal and disturbance fields, and general information about 
geomagnetism, see Merrill et al. (1996) and Parkinson (1983). \r\r\r2.2 DATA ACQUISITION AND QUALITY CONTROL \r\rTo create an accurate magnetic field model, it is necessary to have vector component measurements 
with good global coverage and low noise levels. The three satellites of the European Space Agency (ESA) Swarm mission, launched in November 2013, are presently the most suitable global magnetic field observing 
system. Ground observatory hourly mean data are also available. Although poorer in spatial coverage, the observatory data can provide valuable constraints on the time variations of the geomagnetic field. 
\r\r2.2.1 SATELLITE DATA \r\rThe principal characteristic of satellite data is global coverage using consistent instrumentation collected within a relatively short time span. The inclination of the orbit 
(the angle between the plane containing the satellite�s path and the Earth�s equatorial plane) determines the latitudinal extent of the data coverage: an inclination of 90� provides 100% coverage, an inclination 
of slightly less or slightly more than 90� results in gaps with no data for small regions around the geographic poles. Another important characteristic of satellite data is that localized, small-scale 
\rcrustal magnetization and electromagnetic induction effects close to the Earth surface are strongly attenuated at satellite altitude, resulting in a cleaner magnetic environment for measuring the main 
field. \r\rThe three Swarm satellites slowly drift in local time (details below) with the Earth rotating beneath them. Thus, they provide a crude picture of the entire Earth within 24 hours. During this 
time each satellite completes about 15 orbits, with a longitudinal spacing of around 24 degrees. Swarm data were used in the production of the WMM2020. \r\r 2.2.1.1 SWARM \r\rSwarm (http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/The_Living_Planet_Programme/Earth_Explorers/Swarm) 
is an ESA mission designed for studying all aspects of the Earth�s magnetic field. Swarm is composed of three satellites, two of which fly in a constellation at a lower altitude while the third flies higher 
and is not synchronized with the lower pair (Friis-Christensen et al., 2006). The Swarm satellites were built by Astrium and launched on 22 November 2013 from Plesetsk in Russia on a Rockot launcher into 
a low Earth orbit. The planned mission duration was four years; however, funding for the lifetime of the satellite has been extended until the end of 2021. \r\rSATELLITE AND ORBIT \rSwarm is composed of 
three satellites (A, B, C) which all fly in near-polar orbits. The lower pair (A and C) have inclinations of 87.4� and altitudes of about 450 km in late 2019, while the higher satellite (B) has an inclination 
of about 88� and an altitude of about 500 km. The satellites complete an orbit in approximately 90 minutes at a speed of about 8 km/s. Each satellite weighed 468 kg at launch and is just over 9 m in length 
with the boom deployed. \r\rMAGNETOMETERS \rEach Swarm satellite carries a Vector Field Magnetometer (VFM) mid-boom (Figure 4), built by the Danish Technical University. The VFMs are tri-axis fluxgate 
magnetometers sampling the field at 50 Hz. Once calibrated, they have an accuracy better than 1 nT. Additionally, there is an \rAbsolute Scalar Magnetometer (ASM) at the tip of the boom used to perform 
an absolute calibration of the vector instruments. Each ASM has a redundant sensor. These were built by the French Atomic Energy Commission - Laboratoire d'Electronique de Technologie et d'Instrumentation 
(CEA-Leti), under a contract with the French National Center for Space Studies (CNES). The scalar magnetometers are optically-pumped metastable helium-4 magnetometers, sampling the field at 1 Hz in nominal 
mode, and at 250 Hz in a so-called �burst� mode. They have a resolution of 0.1 nT and an absolute accuracy better than 0.3 nT. \r\rImage of the Swarm satellite and the title and position of the mounted 
instruments.\rFigure 4: Swam instruments. On each satellite, the scalar magnetometer is located at the top of the boom. The vector fluxgate magnetometer is located mid-boom, about 1.6 m from them, and 
is co-mounted with the star imagers.  \r\r\rSTAR IMAGERS \rA star imager, developed and supplied by the Danish Technical University, provides satellite attitude control. An ultra-stable optical bench connects 
the star imager and the vector magnetometer. Attitude uncertainty is the largest source of error in satellite vector magnetic data. Star imagers are often blinded by the sun or moon and provide unreliable 
attitude with regard to rotations about their direction of vision (bore sight). For this reason, Swarm is equipped with a triple-head star imager, while earlier magnetic satellites were equipped with single-head 
(�rsted) or dual-head (CHAMP) star imagers. \r\r\rGLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) RECEIVERS \rEach Swarm satellite is equipped with a dual frequency GPS receiver providing precise positioning and time-tagging 
of the data acquired by the instruments. Precise positioning is also used for spacecraft control. The GPS receivers were provided by ESA. \r\rDATA PRODUCTS \rSwarm�s standard data products are labeled 
from level-0 to level-2, according to the amount of processing applied to the original data. Level-0 products are raw measurements from the onboard instruments. Level-1 products are processed raw measurements 
that are in physical units, as well as having transformations applied so that they are in useful coordinate systems (e.g., geographic). Level-2 refers to scientific products (e.g., field models) which 
make direct use of the Level-1 data. The data used for the WMM comes from the most recent Level-1(b) Swarm dataset (version 0505 and later), which is freely provided by ESA at https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/swarm/data-access. 
 \r\r2.2.1.2 IN-ORBIT CALIBRATION OF SATELLITE MAGNETOMETERS \r\rExperience with several satellite missions shows that calibration parameters can change significantly during deployment into space. Furthermore, 
calibration parameters exhibit gradual changes over the life of the mission. Regular in-flight calibration and updates of the respective parameters is therefore essential. To enable a successful calibration 
in orbit, it is of critical importance that the instruments be built in such a way that they can be described by a linear model with constant (over one day) calibration parameters. While these parameters 
may change slowly over the mission lifetime, they must be independent of strength or direction of the ambient magnetic field. In particular, past satellite magnetic missions have shown that it is not possible 
to perform an in-orbit scalar calibration of a vector magnetometer when the component readings suffer from a �transverse field effect� (Brauer et al., 1997). \r\rThe linear instrument model used for Swarm 
is similar to the one previously used to successfully calibrate the Danish �rsted satellite (Olsen et al., 2003). It can be formulated as a linear transform from the desired quantity B, the magnetic field 
vector in the reference frame of the star tracker, to the instrument output vector E as \r \r E = S  P  R  B  +  b \r (22) \r\r\r \r\rwhere S is a diagonal matrix of scale factors, P corrects for non-orthogonalities 
of the sensor elements, R rotates from the star tracker reference frame into the vector magnetometer frame, and b is the offset vector. Each of these corrections generally has three parameters which have 
to be determined in the calibration. (The Swarm calibration incorporates the characterization of a Sun-driven disturbance field which includes more parameters, see T�ffner-Clausen et al., 2016). \r \rThe 
scalar in-orbit calibration is based on a comparison between the readings of the scalar and vector magnetometer. In a least-squares estimation procedure, the nine calibration parameters of a fluxgate can 
be determined. Here, the synthetic laboratory test field is replaced by the natural ambient field recorded over a day. This allows for regular verification of the offset vector b, non-orthogonalities P, 
and scale factors S.  \r \rThe calibration parameters of the matrix R, namely the three rotation angles between the magnetometer and star tracker reference systems, are determined in a final, independent 
step. To determine these angles, one makes use of the fact that div(B) is zero, and chooses measurements outside of the auroral current regions, where curl(B) is also zero. Under these circumstances, the 
effect of misalignments of the star tracker and vector magnetometer reference system can be separated cleanly from genuine magnetic fields, and the three calibration parameters of the matrix R can be determined 
by a least-squares inversion. This calibration can only succeed if the vector magnetometer and the star tracker are co-mounted onto an optical bench with sufficient rigidity and temperature stability. 
\r \r \r2.2.2 OBSERVATORY DATA \r \rOne of the principal characteristics of observatory data is the long-term continuous coverage over time. The spatial distribution of observatories is largely determined 
by the location of habitable land and by the availability of local expertise, funds and energy supply. While the distribution is uneven and sparse compared to that of satellite data, it has been reasonably 
constant in time (Figure 5).  \r \r \rMap of the locations of observatiories that contribute to the BGS parent model. robinson projection\rFigure 5: Locations of observatories whose data contributed to 
BGS parent model. \r \rINSTRUMENTATION \r \rThere are three categories of instruments at an observatory. The first category comprises variometers, which make continuous measurements of elements of the 
geomagnetic field vector. Both analog and digital variometers require temperature-controlled environments, extremely stable platforms, and can generally operate without manual intervention. Today, the 
most common type of variometer is the tri-axial fluxgate magnetometer. \r \rThe second category comprises absolute instruments that can make measurements of the magnetic field in terms of absolute physical 
basic units or universal physical constants. The most common types of absolute instrument are the fluxgate theodolite, for measuring D and I, and the proton precession magnetometer for measuring F. In 
the former instrument the basic unit of measurement is an angle. To determine these angles, the fluxgate sensor mounted on the telescope of a non-magnetic theodolite is used to detect when it is perpendicular 
to the magnetic field vector. With the fluxgate sensor operating in this null-field mode, the stability of the sensor and its electronics is maximized. To complete the determination of D and I, true north 
is found by reference to a fixed mark of known azimuth, usually by astronomical observations. In a proton precession absolute magnetometer, the universal physical constant is the gyromagnetic ratio of 
the proton. Measurements with a fluxgate theodolite can only be made manually while a proton magnetometer can operate automatically.  \r \rThe third category comprises semi-absolute instruments. These 
instruments measure deviations from a field, which is determined on a regular basis using an absolute instrument. One example is a proton vector magnetometer where artificial orthogonal bias fields are 
applied to a proton precession magnetometer sensor, located at the center of a set of coils through which currents can be passed, to obtain the components of the field vector. Like variometers, these instruments 
are temperature-sensitive and require stable platforms. For more information on magnetic instrumentation and operation of magnetic observatories, see Macmillan (2007), Jankowski and Sucksdorff (1996) and 
Chulliat et al. (2017). \r \rDATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY CONTROL \r \rBGS and NOAA actively collect observatory data through their involvement in the World Data Center (WDC) system. They maintain databases 
suitable for magnetic field modeling, maintain contacts with organizations operating magnetic observatories, and collaborate with other WDCs. Each year BGS sends requests to all organizations with operating 
observatories for the latest data and other relevant information. The WDCs for geomagnetism benefit greatly from the efforts of INTERMAGNET, an organization whose objectives are to establish a global network 
of cooperating digital magnetic observatories, to adopt modern standard specifications for measuring and recording equipment, and to facilitate data exchange and the production of geomagnetic products 
in close to real time. In addition to operating nine of the observatories shown in Figure 5, BGS runs one of five INTERMAGNET GINs (Geomagnetic Information Node), and plays a leading role in the organization 
(https://intermagnet.github.io/). \r \rThe hourly means used in the WMM were selected from definitive data held at https://wdc.bgs.ac.uk/ and from recent quasi-definitive data (Peltier and Chulliat, 2010; 
Clarke et al., 2013) produced primarily by INTERMAGNET observatories. The quality of the data an observatory produces is the responsibility of the operator. The most important aspect of the quality for 
global modeling is the stability of the baseline, the difference between the calibrated variometer data and the absolute observations. A baseline with many points, low scatter, few drifts and offsets is 
an indicator of good quality. Baseline plots for the INTERMAGNET observatories are available along with their definitive data. \r \rQuality assurance and control measures, other than those carried out 
by the observatory operators, are also accomplished by INTERMAGNET through its observatory standardization program, the WDCs, and by participation in the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy 
(IAGA) Observatory Workshops. \r \rFinal quality control procedures prior to deriving the WMM are completed by BGS. For the hourly means this involves plotting all data to identify typographical errors 
and large offsets, and then plotting residuals to hourly models to identify remaining measurement artefacts such as noise, small offsets and trends. Hourly spherical harmonic models of degree 9 and order 
1 are fit to residuals after estimates of the core, crustal and ionospheric fields are removed from the observatory hourly means, the details of which are in Macmillan and Olsen (2013). (Although these 
models are not realistic magnetospheric field models, they help reduce signals that are coherent in time and space.) Observatories used in the production of WMM2020 are listed in Table 7. \r \rTable 7:

indices derived from observatory data, and solar wind data measured by the ACE satellite \r(http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE). These are used to either select the data for input to the model or to form part 
of the input to the model. \r \rINDEX KP \r \rThe planetary Kp (\Planetarische Kennziffer\) index (https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/kp-index/) is based on the K-index, a local index of the three-hourly range 
in magnetic activity of the two horizontal field components (X and Y) relative to an assumed quiet-day curve for the geomagnetic observatory. Local disturbance levels are determined by measuring the range 
(difference between the highest and lowest values) during three-hour time intervals for the most disturbed magnetic field component. The range is then converted into a local K-index according to a pseudo-logarithmic 
scale, which is station specific, in an attempt to normalize the frequency of the different disturbance sizes. The three-hourly Kp index is the average of local K values from 13 selected subauroral stations 
and is expressed in a scale of thirds (28 values). The IAGA station codes (in order of geomagnetic latitude) are: LER, MEA, SIT, ESK, UPS, OTT, BFE, HAD, WNG, NGK, FRD, CNB and EYR. Prior to the averaging, 
the K values are standardized according to station and season. Also CNB and EYR are averaged first, as are UPS and BFE and then used as single points in the overall average of eleven. The Kp index is used 
to select measurements during magnetically undisturbed times.  \r \rINDICES DST AND RC \r \rCharged particles trapped by the geomagnetic field in the magnetosphere drift around the Earth at a distance 
of 3-8 Earth radii creating a westward electric ring current whose field opposes the main geomagnetic field. The strength of this field is on the order of tens of nT during quiet times and several hundred 
nT during magnetic storms. Magnetopause, tail and partial ring currents represent additional contributions leading to asymmetries in the field which increase during storms. The symmetric part of this composite 
disturbance field is tracked by the Dst (disturbance storm-time) index (Sugiura, 1964; http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dstdir) and the RC (ring current) index (Olsen et al., 2014; http://www.spacecenter.dk/files/magnetic-models/RC/current). 
The Dst index is derived from measurements collected at four low-latitude observatories. The RC index is derived from measurements at 21 mid- and low-latitude observatories and is generally thought to 
more accurately track the quiet-time ring current field at ground and low Earth orbit altitude. The Dst and RC indices and their time derivatives are used for data selection. \rINTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC 
FIELD \r \rThe solar wind drives electric currents in the Earth�s magnetosphere and ionosphere. An interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is carried by the plasma of the solar wind. Relevant for the response 
of the magnetosphere is the speed of the solar wind and the direction and strength of the IMF. These solar wind parameters are monitored by NASA�s Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite (http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE) 
and NOAA�s Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite (https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/dscovr-deep-space-climate-observatory). Using magnetospheric models, the ACE solar wind measurements are 
projected downstream onto the magnetospheric bow shock (the boundary between the solar wind and the magnetosphere) and are made available by NASA as 1-minute readings in geocentric magnetospheric coordinates 
at https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/hw.html. The IMF is used both for data selection and as a quantitative parameter to correct for magnetospheric disturbance fields. \r \rMERGING ELECTRIC FIELD EM \r \rThe 
merging electric field, derived from the IMF and solar wind speed (https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/hw.html), is a parameter suitable for describing the variation of the magnetospheric tail current field. 
Following Kan and Lee (1979), the merging electric field, Em, is calculated as \r........=............ .........2+........2.1/2 sin2.2  \r \r\r \r\r(23) \r \rwhere ............ is the solar wind velocity, 
........ and ........ are the IMF components in the Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric (GSM) frame and . is the clock angle of the IMF (i.e., the angle made by the ........ and ........ components of the 
IMF in the vertical plane to the ecliptic, counted from 0 when IMF ........ is north). Here we use a revised definition of the merging electric field, following Newell et al. (2007) and Olsen et al. (2014): 
\r........=0.33 ............4/3 .........2+........2.2/3 sin8/3.2  \r \r\r \r\r(24) \rThe merging electric field is used for data selection. \r \r \r2.3 DERIVATION OF THE MODEL \r \rSince the WMM only 
describes the long-wavelength internal part of the geomagnetic field, it is important to separate unrelated contributions to the field, which would otherwise contaminate the WMM coefficients. A successful 
modeling strategy relies on four elements: \r \r1. DATA SELECTION \r\r\rMeasurements during daytime and during periods of strong solar activity are contaminated by external current systems, which are difficult 
to accurately model. Therefore, only nighttime data measured during magnetically quiet periods, as inferred from the above-described indices, were used in estimating the WMM coefficients. \r \r2. DATA 
CORRECTIONS \rSome contributions to the measured magnetic field, such as the crustal magnetic field, can be accurately modeled and corrected for prior to the estimation of the WMM main field coefficients. 
\r \r3. DATA WEIGHTING \r\r\rThe disturbance field includes features that, even after careful data selection, cannot be modelled. Also, polar orbiting satellites collect more data per unit area at high-latitudes 
than at low-latitudes. Data including these features are downweighted in the estimation of the WMM coefficients. \r \r4. USE OF EXTENDED PARENT MODELS \rTo account for contributions that have not been 
removed in the previous three steps, an extended set of model parameters is co-estimated with the WMM model coefficients. These account for smaller-wavelength internal magnetic field contributions (spherical 
harmonic degree larger than 12), higher time derivatives (e.g., secular acceleration) and contributions from currents external to the Earth. The set of WMM coefficients plus the extended model parameters 
is called a parent model of the WMM. Two separate parent models were produced, reflecting different modeling strategies employed by NCEI and BGS.  \r \r2.3.1 NCEI EXTENDED PARENT MODEL \r \rThe NCEI main 
field and secular variation coefficients for WMM2020 were derived from an extended parent model. The parent model was built entirely from Swarm satellite data, and included a parameterization of the time-dependent 
part of the internal field to spherical harmonic degree and order 15, a parameterization of the static (time-independent) part of the internal field to spherical harmonic degree and order 50, and a set 
of a time-varying alignment parameters describing the rotation between the fluxgate magnetometer instrument frame and the star camera frame on Swarm. Swarm�s attitude is provided by a set of three star 
camera instruments which together define a common reference frame (CRF). The fluxgate axes, however, are not aligned with the CRF axes, and so an additional rotation must be specified between these two 
frames. Additionally, thermal effects can cause these two frames to vary with respect to each other over time, and so we allow these rotation alignment parameters to slowly vary in time. In the following 
sections, we further describe the data selection and preprocessing, data weighting, and model parameters used in the NCEI parent model. \r \rDATA SELECTION  \r \rWhen modeling Earth�s core field, it is 
important to minimize contributions from external fields originating in the ionosphere and magnetosphere. This is accomplished by using data only during certain local time periods when ionospheric contributions 
are minimal. We also use indices designed to track disturbed periods of geomagnetic activity. These indices are derived from a combination of satellite and ground observations. We additionally attempt 
to detect and remove erroneous Swarm measurements from our dataset, which could occur for example during satellite \rmaneuvers, star camera blinding, or other instrument errors. This is accomplished by 
comparing measurements from every Swarm orbit against an a priori core field model. Orbital tracks which show large deviations from the model prediction are discarded. The data selection criteria employed 
for the NCEI parent model are shown in Table 8. \r \rAfter the data selection is performed according to Table 8, we additionally downsample the Swarm data to one sample every 30 seconds. Swarm nominally 
samples the geomagnetic field at 1 Hz, which is a far higher resolution than is needed for the WMM. \r \rTable 8: Data selection criteria for Swarm satellite data used when producing the NCEI parent model.

model assigned weights to each individual datum. Since polar orbiting satellites sample the polar regions more densely than the low-latitudes, we applied the weighting scheme of Alken et al. (2014), which 
is designed to upweight more sparsely sampled equatorial regions, and downweight the densely sampled polar regions, in order to achieve a uniform weighting at all latitudes. Despite careful data selection 
and preprocessing, inevitably a small number of erroneous measurements are included in the model, and so we perform several iterations of model fitting, assigning additional weights at each iteration to 
detect and downweight these \rerroneous outliers. This is done following the procedure of Huber (1996), the so-called robust Huber weighting. \r \rMODEL DESCRIPTION \r \rThe NCEI parent model uses Swarm 
A and B data between November 3, 2016 and November 2, 2019 to determine the WMM2020. The model co-estimates several sets of parameters, as described below: \r1. Time-dependent internal field: each Gauss 
coefficient to spherical harmonic degree and order 15 is parameterized as a quadratic polynomial, accounting for the main field, secular variation, and secular acceleration over the three year time interval. 
This yields a total of 765 time-dependent internal field parameters. \r\r2. Time-independent internal field: each Gauss coefficient between spherical harmonic degrees 16 and 50 is parameterized as a single 
static parameter. These parameters account primarily for the higher resolution lithospheric field. There are a total of 2,345 such parameters in the model. \r\r3. Time-dependent alignment parameters: the 
model estimates a set of alignment parameters between the fluxgate magnetometer instrument frame and the star camera common reference frame. These are parameterized as quadratic splines with knot intervals 
of 30 days over the 3 year time period. There are a total of 228 alignment parameters in the model. \r\r4. The total number of model parameters estimated is 3,338. \r\r\r \rThe NCEI parent model does not 
co-estimate a large-scale magnetospheric field. Instead, it removes the CHAOS external field model from the Swarm measurements, which is parameterized by the RC index (Olsen et al., 2014; Finlay et al., 
2016). The model was estimated using robust iteratively re-weighted least squares with a Levenberg-Marquardt approach. The model was also regularized by minimizing the secular variation in the radial field 
component, averaged over the core mantle boundary. The regularization parameter was chosen to achieve a converging secular variation power spectrum to spherical harmonic degree 15. \r \r \r \r2.3.2 BGS 
EXTENDED PARENT MODEL \r \rThe BGS estimates of the main field and secular variation coefficients for WMM2020 were derived from an extended parent model. This parent model includes smaller wavelength spatial 
features, higher time derivatives of variations, and additional modelled contributions to Earth�s observed field. From this parent model, the large-scale internal field and its secular variation could 
be more accurately extracted. The procedure for selecting, correcting and weighting data to produce the parent model, parameterizing the model, and extracting the desired coefficients, is described in 
the following sections. \r \rDATA SELECTION  \r \rTwo data sources were used to construct the parent model: (1) the ESA Swarm mission, and (2) the ground observatory network. \r \rData were collected from 
available ground observatory locations for the period from 1st January 2013 to 15th October 2019. The distribution of locations is shown Figure 5, and observatory details are summarized in Table 7. Vector 
observations were used at low- and mid-geomagnetic dipole latitudes (GMDL), while for high GMDL, a unit vector given by a prior BGS model of the internal geomagnetic field was used to project the vector 
observations to a pseudo-scalar field value in the prior unit vector direction. The projection of scalar data onto a prior model direction creates a linear relation between these data and the model coefficients 
for which we wish to solve. All data were transformed from the reported geodetic coordinate system to a geocentric coordinate system, and subject to selection for geomagnetically quiet, local night times, 
as summarised in Table 9. Observatory records that contained any unquantified jumps were split about these times and treated as independent data series. Such records are indicated with asterisks in Table 
7. \r \rSwarm data from the Alpha, Bravo and Charlie satellites were collected for the period from mission start on 25th November 2013 to 15th October 2019. The latest available data baselines were used, 
up to version 0507. Vector observations were used at all latitudes, with scalar observations only used when vector data were not available. All data were subjected to a rigorous selection procedure for 
geomagnetically quiet periods. Low- and mid-GMDL data were used only \rduring local night times to avoid the influence of solar-driven fields in the ionosphere, while high GMDL data were used at all local 
times to avoid seasonal gaps in the data. The data selection procedure is summarized in Table 9. \r \rTable 9: Data selection criteria for Swarm satellite and ground observatory data used when producing 
the BGS parent model. \rFilter  Description  Satellite  Observatory  \rSampling    Every datum  20th  1Hz  Hourly  mean  \rKp,  Kp-3h  3-hour planetary K index at datum and in preceding 3-hour interval

WEIGHTING \r \rA prior BGS crustal field model was removed from all satellite and observatory data. Doing so allows the parent modelling process to perform a less complex calculation, solving only for 
the larger-scale and time varying parts of the observed field. \r \rData weights (variances) were assigned to each datum to account for local and global, small- and large-scale sources of uncertainty, 
following the scheme of Thomson et al. (2010). For satellite data, these weights were: \r� Along-track standard deviation over each 20-second orbit segment \r\r� Disturbance field activity as measured 
at the geographically nearest ground observatories (LAVA index, Thomson et al., 2010) \r\r� Spatially uniform noise, scaled by a function of solar zenith angle \r\r� Data density per unit area relative 
to the mean data density \r\r\rFor observatory data, these weights were: \r� Spatially uniform noise, scaled by a function of solar zenith angle, with a higher base value assigned to pseudo-scalar data 
at high GMDL, than for vector data at mid- to low-GMDL \r\r� Data density per unit area relative to the mean data density \r\r\rA final scaling was applied to these weights such that the sum of the total 
weights of observatory data was approximately 10% of the sum of the total weights assigned to satellite data. \r \rMODEL DESCRIPTION \r \rThe BGS parent model co-estimates several field sources, and is 
parameterized as follows. \r� Core field: o Spherical harmonic (SH) degree and order 15 \r\ro Order 6 B-spline time dependence, with 6 month spaced knots from 2012.75 to 2020.75 \r\ro Regularized time 
integral of the 3rd time derivative of the radial magnetic field over the core-mantle boundary (CMB) \r\ro Regularised 2nd time derivative of the radial magnetic field over the CMB, at the spline end knots 
\r\r\r\r\r� Large-scale crustal field correction: o Static in time, described from SH degrees 16 to 30 \r\ro Variation relative to the prior crustal field model used to correct data \r\r\r\r\r� Large-scale 
slowly varying external field: o SH degree and order 1 o order 2 B-spline time dependence, with 3 month spaced knots from 2012.75 to 2020.25 \r\r\r\r\r� Large-scale rapidly varying external and induced 
field: o SH degree and order 1 \r\ro Order 2 B-spline time dependence governed by the VMD index (Thomson and Lesur, 2007) with 3 month spaced knots from 2012.75 to 2020.25 \r\r\r\r\r� Periodic variations: 
o Sine and cosine terms accounting for external and induced, annual and semi-annual variations \r\ro External sine and cosine terms accounting for diurnal variations, parameterised by sun-synchronous longitude 
\r\r\r\r\r� Local crustal biases: o static offsets at each observatory location to account for small-scale crustal field \r\r\r\r\r\r \rThe model was fit by robust iteratively-reweighted least-squares, 
and converged within three iterations. Damping was chosen to balance the fit to the data against the level of temporal smoothing applied to the core field by the regularisation. \r \rDERIVATION OF BGS 
MAIN FIELD AND SECULAR VARIATION COEFFICIENTS FOR WMM2020 \r \rThe BGS secular variation coefficients for 2020 to 2025 were taken to be the mean of the instantaneous secular variation coefficients of the 
parent model, from 2018.5 to 2019.5 in 0.1 year increments, inclusive. This period was chosen to be as up-to-date as possible given the data used, while avoiding end-effects of the temporal B-spline parameterisation. 
These secular variation coefficients were then used to calculate the BGS main field coefficients at 2020.0, by propagating the instantaneous main field coefficients of the parent model at 2019.5 forward 
in time by six months. \r \r \r \r \r \r2.3.3 VALIDATION PROCESS \r \rEach parent model was validated by comparing it to other similar recent models (developed by NCEI, BGS and other organizations, e.g. 
for the International Geomagnetic Reference Field) and to a global set of geomagnetic observatory data. Inter-comparison of NCEI and BGS parent models provided a semi-independent validation of each model, 
as both models were derived using slightly different datasets and methods, and fully independent algorithms. The final coefficients were obtained by averaging the NCEI and BGS coefficients for the main 
field and the secular variation. The final model was again validated using the same approach as above before being approved for public release. \r \r  \r3.  MODEL UNCERTAINTIES \r \rThe WMM2020 is valid 
for the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2024, from 1 km below the WGS 84 ellipsoid surface to approximately 850 km above it. Like any physical model, it contains uncertainties that must be carefully 
considered by its users. This section discusses the various sources of uncertainty for the WMM2020 and quantifies the uncertainties associated with each source at or near the Earth�s surface. The uncertainties 
are then combined into a total error budget, which forms the basis of a simple error model providing the uncertainty for each component of the field. Note that the uncertainties are estimated at the Earth�s 
surface so the WMM vertical validity range is approximate. \r \r3.1 SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY \r \rApart from human-made disturbances of the measurement, which are not discussed here, there are two sources 
of disagreement between magnetic field observations and the WMM. The first is due to inaccuracies in the model coefficients and is often referred to as the commission error. The second is due to the fact 
that the WMM does not account for all of the contributions to the observed magnetic field and is often referred to as the omission error. \r \rThe commission error is the sum of errors due to inaccuracies 
in main field coefficients, describing the field in 2020.0, and predictive secular variation coefficients, describing the linear part of the field variation from 2020.0 to 2025.0. Since the early 2000s, 
inaccuracies have been much reduced due to a series of high-precision magnetic survey satellites. However, in the case of the secular variation there is an additional error due to the fact that the true 
secular variation is not exactly linear. This is because changes of the fluid flow in the Earth�s outer core lead to slightly nonlinear changes in the Earth�s magnetic field. The nonlinear part of the 
secular variation is currently unpredictable, but, fortunately, it is small compared to the linear secular variation. It follows that, by surveying the field for several years, one can precisely map the 
present field and its rate of change, and then linearly extrapolate the rate out into the future for several years. Provided that suitable satellite magnetic observations are available, the prediction 
of the WMM is highly accurate on its release date and then subsequently deteriorates towards the end of the 5-year epoch, when it has to be updated with revised values of the model coefficients. \r \rNon-linear 
core field variations are often related to short-lived, global increases in the power of the second order time derivative of the core field, a phenomenon referred to as a �secular acceleration pulse�. 
Over the past 20 years, high-quality, low-Earth orbit satellite data have provided an increasingly detailed picture of acceleration pulses (e.g., Chulliat and Maus, 2014). At least four pulses have been 
detected; these pulses were centered near 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2016 and lasted two to three years. They were strongest at mid-to-low latitudes and had spatially and temporally alternating polarity (i.e., 
for example, a positive secular acceleration in 2006 was followed by a negative one in 2009). At many magnetic observatories, pulses were preceded and/or followed by so-called �geomagnetic jerks�, or sudden 
changes in the secular variation rate of change at a given location. Geomagnetic jerks have long been observed and are ubiquitous in observatory data (e.g., Brown et al., 2013). Recent research suggests 
that acceleration pulses and at least some geomagnetic jerks might be related to hydromagnetic waves in the Earth�s core (e.g., Aubert and Finlay, 2019). When a large pulse occurs just after the release 
of the WMM, non-linear core field variations can lead to significant errors in the WMM predictions after a few years. Such was the case during the WMM2015 cycle; the issue was fixed by releasing an out-of-cycle 
update of the WMM (Chulliat et al., 2019). \r \rThe omission error is due to portions of the geomagnetic field that cannot be described by the WMM because either their spatial scale is too small or their 
time scale is too short. Most of these contributions are generated in the Earth�s crust and upper mantle, and in the ionosphere and magnetosphere, whereas the long-wavelength portion of the Earth�s magnetic 
field represented by the WMM originates within the Earth�s fluid outer core. Sources in the crust and upper mantle produce static spatial anomalies, and sources in the ionosphere and magnetosphere produce 
rapidly varying disturbance fields, either global or regional. The omission error is the largest contributor to the total error (see section 3.2) and can reach very large values in some locations and at 
certain times. For example, differences between the observed declination and the WMM can exceed 10 degrees. Anomalies of this magnitude are uncommon but do exist. Declination anomalies on the order of 
3 or 4 degrees are not uncommon but are usually of small spatial or temporal extent. \r \rOn land, spatial anomalies are produced by mountain ranges, ore deposits, cloud to ground lightning, geological 
faults, etc. The corresponding deviations are usually smaller at sea, increase with increasing latitude, and decrease with increasing altitude of an air- or spacecraft. In ocean areas these anomalies occur 
most frequently along continental margins, near seamounts, and near ocean ridges, trenches and fault zones, particularly those of volcanic origin. \r \rSince the crustal field is almost constant in time, 
it can be inferred from all available satellite, marine and aeromagnetic measurements of the past decades. These data have been compiled into a spherical harmonic degree-790 Enhanced Magnetic Model (EMM), 
available at https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/EMM. Developed as research models for NGA, the EMM2017 provides consistent global representation of the magnetic field, including the crustal field, down to 
wavelengths of approximately 51 kilometers. The WMM subroutine library was designed so that it can be used with the EMM. Use of the EMM should be considered in applications with higher demands in pointing 
accuracy. \r \r \r3.2 ESTIMATING UNCERTAINTY \r \rVarious approaches were used to estimate the WMM2020 uncertainty. Some approaches provide the uncertainties associated with one type of error and/or one 
omitted source, while others provide combined uncertainties for different sources. It is important to recognize that the omission error, particularly the one associated to the crustal field, dominates 
over the commission error, and that the omitted sources are only partially sampled in space and time. Therefore, it is not possible to precisely estimate the WMM2020 uncertainty in every location at the 
Earth�s surface. What is achievable is a global estimate of the uncertainty, based upon a statistical analysis of the differences between the WMM2020 and its predecessors and independent geomagnetic measurements 
in as many locations as possible at the Earth�s surface. \r \r3.2.1 FORMAL COMMISSION ERROR \r \rThe errors on the Gauss coefficients of the WMM2020 can be formally estimated from the variance-covariance 
matrix of these coefficients, defined as \r....= ......... .... ......1 \r\r \r\r(25) \rwhere .... is the Jacobian matrix of the nonlinear least squares penalty function used when calculating the NCEI 
parent model, and .... is a diagonal weighting matrix whose entries are given by ........=1/........2, with ........ the error of the i-th measurement. The measurement error is the sum of the instrument 
error and the error caused by un-modeled fields at satellite altitude. A total measurement error .... was estimated using the final Gauss coefficients of the model as the RMS \r(root mean square) of the 
differences between measurements and model predictions. This total error was assigned to each measurement in the weighting matrix. \r \rThe errors on the Gauss coefficients were then propagated to errors 
in magnetic field elements X, Y, Z, H, F, I and D. Taking for example the X element, and computing its model prediction as a set of points all over the Earth�s surface will yield a vector X. This vector 
is linearly related to the Gauss coefficients (see equations 10, 11 and 12 in section 1.2) and so we can write ....=.... .... for a matrix ..... The variance-covariance matrix of the X element will then 
be \r........= .... .... ........ (26) \rSimilar expressions exist for the Y and Z elements. The diagonal elements of this matrix then give us estimates of the commission error for our chosen set of measurement 
points. The X, Y and Z errors can then be propagated to obtain the errors in H, F, I, D and GV (north and south). The global RMS commission errors are given in Table 10. \r \rTable 10: Formal commission

used by BGS and NOAA, some insight into the errors arising from incorrect modelling and prediction of the core field signal up to degree 12 can be gained by inter-comparing their respective models and 
by comparing preliminary and final WMM2020 with WMM2015 (original version, referred to as WMM2015v1 in what follows) and WMM2015v2 (out-of-cycle update, cf. Chulliat et al., 2019). These comparisons are 
done by computing the component values on a 1� latitude/longitude grid (defined using geocentric latitude), \rand calculating RMS differences weighted by the cosine of the latitude. The north and south 
BoZs (as defined in section 1.7) are excluded from declination and grid variation (north and south) calculations. Table 11 lists these differences.  \r \rNote the large GVN and GV errors at the end of 
the 2015-2020 interval (Table 11, rows 3a and 6a) for the WMM2015v1 model, compared to the same errors for WMM2010 at 2015.0 (row 6c). These errors were related to the fast drift of the north magnetic 
dip pole during the 2015-2020 cycle, and the occurrence of a geomagnetic jerk at the beginning of that cycle. GVS errors were much smaller, reflecting a slower drift of the south dip pole. The detection 
of large grid variation errors as part of the regular performance assessment of WMM2015v1 prompted the development and release of the WMM2015v2 out-of-cycle update. The new model significantly reduced 
the commission error for all components, including GVN and GV (rows 3b and 6b). Note also the significantly larger errors for all components incurred by the WMM after ten years (rows 7a, 7b and 8). \r

future. However, the largest errors in declination and grid variation will again be concentrated near the magnetic poles where the strength of the horizontal component of the field is lowest. \r \r \rThe

high resolution crustal field models (such as the EMM) exist, they only describe the largest spatial scales of the crustal field. Therefore, any rigorous attempt to quantify the crustal field contribution 
to the omission error should rely on actual field measurements. A first method \rfor estimating the crustal field error consisted in comparing past WMM predictions with (a) trackline data from 189 aeromagnetic 
and marine surveys archived in NGDC�s GEODAS (GEOphysical DAta System) and collected over 2000-2014, and (b) data from 175 geomagnetic observatories archived at BGS�s World Data Centre for Geomagnetism 
in Edinburgh and collected over 2000-2018. (Step (a) is identical to the error analysis reported in the WMM2015 Technical Report; step (b) is an updated and improved version.) \r  \rTrackline data have 
several advantages compared to observatory data when investigating the crustal field error. First, they sample the crustal field at a much larger number of points. The GEODAS dataset used for this analysis 
includes a total of 6,857,662 data points at different locations, to be compared with 175 observatory locations. Second, trackline data are typically acquired a few kilometers above the crustal field sources 
(due to the plane altitude or the depth of the ocean below the survey vessel), which reduces the amplitude of the smallest spatial scales of the field, including very local human-made anomalies. There 
are disadvantages, however, as only total field data are available from marine and aeromagnetic surveys and it is generally impossible to separate the crustal field from the external field in such data. 
The following analysis is an attempt at combining advantages from both trackline and observatory datasets. \r \rAs a first step, residuals between trackline data and past WMM predictions over 2000-2014 
were calculated and sorted according to absolute corrected geomagnetic latitude. Overall, the residuals were found to be normally distributed. RMS values of residuals within each 10 degrees latitudinal 
bin were then calculated. The obtained values (Figure 10) include both the commission error (mostly the error due to incorrect prediction of the secular variation over each WMM five-year time interval, 
see section 3.2.2) and the omission error, with contributions from both the crustal field and the external field. There is a small but clear dependence of the error with latitude, partly due to an increase 
of the crustal field strength with latitude, as shown by models such as the degree-790 Enhanced Magnetic Model (EMM), and partly due to the effect of the external field which becomes larger on average 
near 65� geomagnetic latitude (see section 3.2.5). \r \r \rLine graph showing RMS differences between trackline data and WMM for years 2000 to 2014 along absolute geomagnetic latitude (legend on right 
side of graph (in nanoTesla)) and corresponding number of data points in each ten degree latitudinal bin (legend on left side of graph (in millions of points).\rFigure 10: RMS differences between trackline 
data and WMM for years 2000-2014, sorted according to absolute corrected geomagnetic latitude (Richmond, 1995), and corresponding number of data in each 10 degrees latitudinal bin. \r As a second step 
of the analysis, hourly mean values from 175 observatories over 2000-2018 were least-square fitted by cubic splines with knots every year. This procedure removes most of the external field, which varies 
with timescales smaller than one year, except for some small external fields varying with the 11-year solar cycle. Each spline fit therefore represents the sum of the crustal and core fields at the observatory 
location. RMS differences between spline fits and WMM predictions were then calculated for each component within 10� latitudinal bins. The RMS error on F was found much larger than the one from trackline 
data; for example, the RMS error for the 10 to 50 degrees latitude bin (i.e., the four 10 degrees latitude bins between 10 and 50 degrees) is 383 nT, compared to 137 nT from trackline data. This result 
reflects the very heterogeneous spatial distribution of the global observatory network, which includes observatories located on top of large amplitude but small size crustal field anomalies such as basaltic 
islands. In order to circumvent this limitation, observatory data were selected so that the resulting RMS error on F matches the one obtained from trackline data in the 10 to 50 degrees latitude bin. This 
bin is where the external field is expected to have its smallest contribution to trackline data and where most data are available. A robust outlier detection algorithm was used to achieve this observatory 
selection, leading to the selection of 86 out of 112 observatories in the 10 to 50 degrees bin, and a total of 134 out of 175 observatories for all latitudes. The weighted RMS error values for each component 
are given in Table 12 (rows 1 and 2). Note that grid variation north (GVN) and south (GVS) are not separated in Table 12 as (a) the dominant source of error is the unmodeled crustal field which is assumed 
to be of the same order of magnitude in both hemispheres, and (b) there was not enough data to robustly \rseparate GVN and GVS. Observatories in the north and south BoZs (as defined in section 1.7) were 
excluded from this analysis. \r\rIn order to separate error contributions from the crustal field and the secular variation, RMS differences between spline fits and WMM predictions were calculated on the 
first day of each model epoch (2000.0, 2005.0, 2010.0 and 2015.0), and for the same 134 out of 175 observatories selected when calculating RMS differences over the full 2000-2018 interval. The results 
are crustal field only error values and are provided in Table 12 (row 3). Corresponding secular variation error values (row 4) were obtained by subtracting row 3 from row 2 in quadrature. \r\rTable 12:

F is the same as that from trackline data in the 10 to 50 degrees corrected geomagnetic latitude bin. Row 4 is obtained by subtracting row 3 from row 2 in quadrature. \rRow X (nT) Y (nT) Z (nT) H (nT)

Magnetic Models/World Chart Models since 1980 (the first time charts were produced jointly between U.K. and U.S.) were compared with compilations of ground-based vector data. Each of the seven models comprises 
main-field coefficients at a base epoch and predictive \rsecular variation coefficients valid for the following five years. Two data compilations were used in the comparison: (1) repeat station and land 
survey data and (2) observatory annual means. Both compilations are from the World Data Centre for Geomagnetism (Edinburgh) and have only modest contamination from external fields, as data are mostly reduced 
to quiet night time or annual mean equivalents in (1) and annual averaging smooths out much of the unwanted signal in (2). The reason for going so far back in time was to achieve a better spatial coverage. 
This is still far from ideal but is shown in Figure 11. \r \r \rMaps of the locations of repeat stations, vector land surveys and observatories that provide data for model comparisons in 5 year periods.

for model comparisons. Maps show locations of data in the 5 year WMM period from each date shown. \r \rRMS differences were computed for all seven elements, and for each of the eight models after elimination 
of outliers (any differences greater than 3 standard deviations). The sample sizes vary according to the element but are greater than 20000. Table 13 (row 1) lists these RMS \rdifferences. Note that there 
was not enough data to robustly separate grid variation north (GVN) and south (GVS) in this analysis. Also, no data were used in the north and south BoZs (as defined in section 1.7). In an approach similar 
to that used in section 3.2.3, RMS differences were calculated on the first year of each model epoch to determine the contribution to the error from the crustal field only. The results are reported in 
Table 13 (row 2). \r \rThe contribution to the overall error budget for the WMM from the crustal field estimated here using vector data collected on land is conservative, i.e. over-cautious. One way of 
justifying the use of lower values is to employ near-surface scalar data, i.e., total intensity. These data are plentiful as they are relatively easy to collect from ships and aircraft and, importantly, 
they cover both land and sea. Global scalar anomaly compilations have been made in recent years, for example the World Digital Magnetic Anomaly Map (WDMAM, Lesur et al., 2016) and NOAA�s Earth Magnetic 
Anomaly Grids EMAG2 (Maus et al., 2009) and EMAG2v3 (Meyer et al., 2017). The mean absolute differences for F derived from the land-based vector observations can be compared with those from global compilations. 
For WDMAM (version 2) the mean absolute anomaly in F is 107 nT, for EMAG2 it is 105 nT and for EMAG2v3 it is 83 nT. These are likely to be underestimates at the Earth�s surface because these compilations 
are above the surface at 5 km and 4 km, respectively. However, even if these were to be downward-continued to the Earth�s surface they would not be as high as the value from the repeat stations and observatories 
(201 nT). Another source of scalar data is NOAA�s GEODAS (GEOphysical DAta System), as described in section 3.2.3. For 2000 onwards, the spatial distribution of these data is not as good as that of the 
WDMAM and EMAG2, but they are collected at the Earth�s surface. The RMS difference between these data over 2000-2014 and the relevant WMM is 137 nT.  \r \rFollowing the same approach as in the WMM2015 
Technical Report, the values from the repeat stations and observatories are scaled according to the mean of the RMS difference from EMAG2 and the GEODAS surveys (121 nT) and are shown in Table 13 (row 
3). \r \rTable 13: RMS differences between observations and models in World Magnetic Model series since 1980, using all data (row 1) or only data collected on the same year as the model epoch (row 2).

plus the corresponding contributions from currents induced by the external time-varying magnetic fields in the Earth and oceans. The strength of the disturbance field is modulated by the 11-year solar 
cycle. Periods of strong magnetic activity (magnetic storms) occur primarily at solar maximum, although they tend to lag behind the solar cycle by about two years. The epoch of WMM2020 starts in the quietest 
part of the solar cycle (near the end of Solar Cycle 24) and extends into an increasingly more active part (the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 25). \r \rThe contribution from the disturbance field to the 
WMM uncertainty was estimated from hourly mean values recorded at 175 magnetic observatories over 2000-2018 (see section 3.2.3). RMS residuals between the data and the cubic spline fit over 2000-2018 were 
calculated for each observatory and each component. The obtained variation with latitude (Figure 12) is in good agreement the known properties of the external field. Near the geomagnetic equator, the northern 
external field is enhanced by the so-called equatorial electrojet, a strong electrical current flowing at 110 km altitude along the equator. At higher latitudes, near 65� geomagnetic latitude, intense 
auroral electrojets can lead to variations as large as several thousands of nT during geomagnetic storms. However, on average, the contribution of the external field to the total error is much smaller 
than that of the crustal field and for this reason its latitude dependency is neglected in what follows. The global RMS error values for each component are given in Table 14. \r \rTable 14: RMS residuals,

of the error analysis are summarized in Table 15: \r� Although a formal commission error can be calculated (Table 10), a more realistic estimate of the commission error at 2020.0 (Table 15, row 2) is provided 
by taking RMS differences of the final NOAA and BGS models for that epoch (Table 11, row 9).  \r\r� The commission error at 2025.0 (Table 15, row 3), which is dominated by the secular variation forecasting 
error over the next five years, is obtained by averaging the RMS differences between WMM2020 and WMM2015v1 at 2020.0 (Table 11, row 6a), and the RMS differences between WMM2015 and WMM2010 at 2015.0 (Table 
11, row 6c). These quantities correspond to the true secular variation forecasting errors over each of the past two WMM cycles for each component. \r\r� The two methods used for obtaining the crustal field 
contribution have complementary merits and limitations. Therefore, we averaged the results from both methods (Table 12, row 3 and Table 13, row 3) to obtain a final estimate for the crustal field omission 
error (Table 15, row 4). \r\r� The disturbance field omission error (Table 15, row 5) is the one reported in Table 14. \r\r\r \rSince these errors are statistically independent, the expected total errors 
at 2020.0 (row 6) and 2025.0 (row 7) are calculated as the root of the sum of squares of rows 2, 4 and 5, and rows 3, 4 and 5, respectively. For example, the total error at 2020.0 between the observed 
and modeled declination is estimated to be \r \r .0.012+0.302+0.222=0.37� \r (27) \r\r\r \r\rNote that all error values increase between 2020 and 2025 due to the secular variation forecasting error at 
the end of the WMM validity interval. The largest relative increase occurs for GVN; it is related to the fast drift of the north magnetic dip pole, as noted in section 3.2.2. \r \rThe accuracy requirements 
for the WMM are detailed in the military specification MIL-W-89500B (Department of Defense, 2019) and are provided in row 1 of Table 15. In summary, the requirement is that the global RMS difference between 
the WMM and the observed magnetic field on the WGS 84 ellipsoid surface should be within 1� for D, I, GVN and GVS, within 200 nT for H and within 280 nT for F for the entire 5-year lifetime of the model. 
We find that the combined error values (rows 6 and 7) are all lower than the required values. During the WMM cycle, NCEI and \rBGS regularly update the combined error estimates using the most recent data 
available to ensure that the model remains within specification. \r \rTable 15: Estimated global RMS errors in WMM2020. Higher values of GV (compared to D) reflect the larger uncertainties of the declination 
at high latitudes, the only regions where GV is defined. Higher values of GVN compared to GVS reflect the faster drift of the north dip pole compared to the south dip pole. \rRow  X (nT) Y (nT) Z (nT)

(X, Y, Z, H, F, I and D) and every location on the WGS 84 ellipsoid surface. This model is built upon the results of the error analysis (see section 3.3), while taking into account the geometrical relationships 
between the various components [formulas (19) in section 1.2].  \r \rThe first part of the error model was built by taking the average of rows 6 and 7 of Table 15 as variances of the X, Y and Z components, 
and assuming that off-diagonal terms of the variance-covariance matrix for (X, Y, Z) are zero: \r........= 131 nT ........= 94 nT ........= 157 nT  \r\r(28) (29) (30) \rThe error in (X, Y, Z) was then 
propagated onto (F, I, D, H) by linearizing the relationships (19) between (F, I, D, H) and (X, Y, Z) and neglecting the off-diagonal terms: \r........= .[(........)2(cos....)2+(........)2(sin....)2]  
.... ........= .[(........)2(sin....)2+(........)2(cos....)2] ........= .[(........)2(cos....)2+(........)2(sin....)2] .... ........= .[(........)2(sin....)2+(........)2(cos....)2]  \r (31) \r\r\r \r \r 
(32) \r\r\r \r \r (33) \r\r\r \r \r (34) \r\r\r \r\rIn order to remove non-physical variations in ........, ........ and ........, these quantities were averaged over the WGS 84 ellipsoid yielding: \r........= 
128 nT ........= 145 nT ........= 0.21�  \r\r(35) (36) (37) \rAs expected, these values are close to the error budget values (Table 15), which suggests that the error analysis is consistent. \r \rThe case 
of ........ is different, as H goes to zero at the North and South magnetic poles and therefore ........ goes to infinity there. Adopting a global average for ........ would thus seriously underestimate 
the declination error near the poles. To address this difficulty, the following formula was built: \r \r ........= .(0.26)2+(5625/....)2 \r (38) \r\r\r \r\rwhere ........ is expressed in degrees. This 
formula is such that: \r\r \rA global map of the corresponding declination error is provided in Figure 13. At mid- to low-latitudes, the error is close to or slightly lower than the average of the 2020.0 
and 2025.0 error budget values (0.37� and 0.42�, respectively, cf. Table 15, rows 6 and 7). The error becomes larger near the magnetic dip poles and in an area close to South Africa where the horizontal 
field is very low. The average value of the D error from equation (38) is equal to 0.43� which is close to the error budget value. \r \rThe final error model is thus made of equations (28)-(30) and (35)-(38). 
The uncertainties in X, Y, Z, H, F and I are assumed to be constant over the globe, while the uncertainty in D is assumed to vary with location. All uncertainties are assumed to be constant with altitude 
in the model validity range (from 1 km below the WGS 84 ellipsoid surface to approximately 850 km above it). \r \r \rThe distribution of declination error provided by the WMM2020. robinson projection\rFigure

 The magnetosphere is a large cavity produced by the Earth's main magnetic field. Essentially, the charged particles of the solar wind cannot move across magnetic field lines and are deflected around the 
Earth. The complex interactions of the Earth's magnetic field with the solar wind give rise to a multitude of electric current systems, which flow at typical distances of 2 to 20 Earth radii from the surface.,

 Observers close to the Earth's surface (e.g. magnetic observatories, aircraft and low-orbiting satellites), see the combined magnetic field of all of the magnetospheric currents. This magnetospheric field 
has a strength of up to 50 nT during magnetically quiet times, reaching several hundred nT during magnetic storms.,
 The ring current is the most prominent system in the inner magnetosphere. Since it is closely coupled to the magnetic field, it can be described quite efficiently in the solar-magnetic (SM) coordinate 
frame. Dominant currents in the outer magnetosphere are the magnetopause surface currents and the cross-trail current. These currents are thought to be organized in the geocentric-solar-magnetospheric 
(GSM) frame. Further descriptions of these coordinate systems, and software to transform a spherical harmonic expansion from GSM or SM to the Earth-fixed frame (GEO) are given on a separate web page.,

 Interestingly, magnetospheric fields which are steady in the GSM frame appear as daily and annually varying fields in the Earth-fixed frame. This is illustrated in Figure 2: An observer at Greenwich sees 
a constant southward magnetospheric field at noon as a horizontal field in summer and a vertical field in winter, interpreting this as an annual variation. Similarly, the horizontal field seen in the summer 
at noon is seen as a vertical field at midnight, which is observed as a daily variation.,
 These temporal variations of the external field, as seen from an Earth-fixed reference frame, induce electric currents in the Earth which give rise to secondary magnetic fields (Maus and Lühr, 2005),

 Movement of electrically conducting sea water through the geomagnetic field induces electric fields, currents and secondary magnetic fields (Sanford, 1971). It has long been speculated that tsunamis produce 
measurable perturbations in the magnetic field (Larsen, 1971; Tyler, 2005). Recent deployments of highly accurate magnetometers and the exceptionally deep solar minimum provided ideal conditions to identify 
these small signals for the tsunami resulting from the strong Chilean earthquake on February 27, 2010. The magnetic observatory measurements on Easter Island, 3500 km west of the epicenter, measured a 
periodic signal of 1 nT, coincident in time with recordings from the local tide gauge. The amplitude of this signal is consistent with the sea level variation caused by the tsunami in the open ocean near 
Easter Island.,

Center for Tsunami Research. The red and black triangles show the locations of DART buoys. b) Vertical component magnetic field variations at IPM, PPT and HUA. b-inset) Tide gauge (blue) at Easter Island 
compared with magnetometer-inferred sea level variation (green). c) Same comparison with time-shifted pressure observations from DART buoy 51406. Periods longer than 1 hour were removed from all data by 
fitting splines.,
 The recent magnitude 8.8 earthquake off the Chilean coast (February 27, 2010 at 06:34:14 UTC 35.846°S, 72.719°W) produced a moderate tsunami that traversed the Pacific Ocean westward (see the Figure). 
Exceptionally quiet magnetic conditions on this day (the planetary index for the magnetic disturbances from sources external to Earth was lowest in its scale during 0:00-15.00 UTC) provided a unique opportunity 
to verify the hypothesis that tsunamis generate measurable magnetic fields. The newly-constructed Easter Island observatory (code IPM) is located about 3500 km to the west of the epicenter. Further west 
is Pamatai (PPT) on Tahiti, while the Huancayo observatory (HUA) is situated north of the event in Peru. At the time of the Chilean earthquake, PPT and IPM were recording at a sampling rate of 1 second 
and HUA at 1 minute. IPM shows a periodic signal of 1 nT in the vertical component (Z) starting at 11:35 UTC. The other two observatories do not show concurrent variations, indicating a local origin of 
the signal. Commencement of the signal at IPM is coincident with the arrival time of the tsunami predicted by the U. S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Tsunami Research Center. Further 
west, at 7000 km distance from the epicenter, the tsunami magnetic signal at PPT (not shown) is not easily distinguishable from the background at the expected tsunami arrival time (17:30 UTC). This is 
to be expected since the tsunami wave height recorded by tide gauge near PPT is one fifth of that recorded near IPM.,
 The sea level variation due to tsunami around Easter Island can be inferred (Tyler, 2005) from the product of the tsunami-generated magnetic signal (±1 nT) and the average depth of the water column (3000 
m in a 2° x 2° area), divided by the vertical component of the ambient magnetic field (19000 nT). Inferred amplitudes of 15 cm are consistent with the wave height predicted from the Method of Splitting 
Tsunami (MOST, by the NOAA Tsunami Research Center ) model and with bottom pressure variations seen by NOAA’s Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami (DART) buoy 51406, 2650 km north-west of Easter 
Island. A more accurate prediction of sea-level variation from the magnetic field observations requires numerical solution of the electromagnetic induction equation for a tsunami flow model. Recordings 
of the tide gauge at Easter Island are displayed together with the magnetometer-derived sea level variation in the inset. The tide gauge exhibits the first major crest at 11:50 UTC, 15 minutes after the 
arrival of the tsunami and commencement of magnetic signals, due to its location on the western coast, in the shadow of the Island. It records higher amplitudes and frequencies, typical for the variation 
and resonances of a tsunami in shallow water. In contrast, the magnetically derived sea level variation is less affected by local bathymetry and is therefore more consistent with the waveform in the deep 
ocean.,
 Magnetic measurements are sensitive to motion in the deep ocean and therefore provide valuable information about sea level variation. The tsunami magnetic signals may be used one day in a monitoring system. 
A recent study (Manoj et al., 2010) found that tsunamis could also induce observable electric potentials in deep sea cables. In both cases, however, magnetospheric disturbances could limit the practical 
utility of tsunami electromagnetic monitoring to periods of low solar activity. An immediate application is to use the magnetic inferred amplitude and wave characteristics to understand the tsunami progress 
in the vicinity.,
 The geomagnetic data used in this study are from observatories operated by the Bureau Central de Magnétisme Terrestre, France (IPM and PPT,), the Direccion Meteorologica de Chile (IPM) and the Instituto 
Geofisico del Peru, Peru (HUA). The DART data are obtained from NOAA's National Data Buoy Center for DART data. The base-map for the figure is from NOAA's Tsunami Research Center. The tide gauge data at

 The geomagnetic field protects the Earth's atmosphere against charged particles from the solar wind. Rapid and long-term changes in the field are monitored by low-orbiting satellites and a global network 
of about 200 magnetic observatories. Field models, computed from these measurements, provide the direction and strength of the magnetic field at any desired location. Magnetometers (or a simple compass) 
can then be used to compute pointing directions, complementing the location information provided by the global positioning system (GPS).,
 Earth's magnetic field is used in a wide variety of applications.  It is used to despin satellites, explore natural resources, survey property boundaries, point antennas and solar panels, conduct research, 
study Earth's tectonic history, and to navigate on land, sea, and air.,
 Without the magnetic field, life on Earth as we know it would not be possible as it shields us all from the constant bombardment by charged particles emitted from the sun — the solar wind. (To learn what 
happens to a planet when it loses its magnetic field, you only need to look at Mars.),
 Earth has two sets of poles, geographic pole and magnetic poles. Earth's magnetic field can be visualized if you imagine a large bar magnet inside our planet, roughly aligned with Earth's axis. Each end 
of the magnet lies relatively close (about 10 degrees) to the geographic North and South poles. Earth's invisible magnetic field lines travel in a closed, continuous loop and are nearly vertical at each 
magnetic pole.,
 Geographic North and South poles are where lines of longitude converge according to GIS Geography (opens in new tab). The Geographic North Pole is located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean and the Geographic 
South Pole is found in Antarctica. ,
 Magnetic poles are located where the magnetic lines of attraction enter Earth. The Magnetic North Pole is also known as the North Dip Pole and is currently found on Ellesmere Island in Northern Canada. 
When a magnetic compass points north it is aligning itself with Earth's magnetic field and points to the Magnetic North Pole, not the Geographic North Pole, which is actually about 310 miles (500 kilometers) 
away according to GIS Geography! ,
 And just to make things that little more confusing, what we call the North Magnetic Pole is actually a south magnetic pole… bear with me on this. Magnetic field sources are dipolar, meaning they have 
a north and south pole. And when it comes to magnets, opposite poles (N and S) attract while other poles (N and N, S and S) repel. So when a compass points north, it is actually attracted to the south 
magnetic pole which lies close to the Geographic North Pole, according to Physicist Christopher Baird's science FAQ website (opens in new tab) \Surprising Questions with Surprising Answers.\ ,
 Unlike the geographic poles, Earth's magnetic poles are not fixed and tend to wander over time. British polar explorer James Clark Ross first identified the Magnetic North Pole on the Boothis Peninsula 
in Canada's Nunavut territory in 1831, according to the Antarctic travel site Antarctic Logistics (opens in new tab). Since its discovery, the magnetic north pole moves about 25 miles (40 kilometers) a 
year in a northwest direction according to the Royal Museums Greenwich (opens in new tab). Whatsmore, Earth's magnetic poles have also 'flipped' whereby north becomes south and south becomes north. These 
magnetic reversals occur at irregular intervals every 200,000 years or so.  ,
 Earth's magnetic field is generated by what is known as the geodynamo process. According to National Geographic (opens in new tab), for a planet to generate its own magnetic field by the geodynamo process, 
it must have the following characteristics:,
 The generation of Earth's magnetic field occurs deep within the Earth's interior, in a layer known as the outer core to be precise. Here the convective energy from the slow-moving molten iron is converted 
to electrical and magnetic energy, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (opens in new tab). The magnetic field then induces electric currents which in turn generate their own magnetic field which induces 
more electric currents, in a positive feedback loop.,
 Our protective magnetic \bubble,\ known as the magnetosphere, protects us from harmful space weather such as solar wind. Without the magnetosphere, the solar wind would erode our atmosphere, devoiding 
our planet of the life-giving air we breathe. ,
 According to NASA (opens in new tab), the magnetosphere also protects Earth from large quantities of particle radiation emitted during coronal mass ejection (CME) events and also from cosmic rays — atom 
fragments — raining down on Earth from deep space. The magnetosphere repels harmful energy away from Earth and traps it in zones called the Van Allen radiation belts. These donut-shaped belts of radiation 
can swell when the sun's activity increases. ,
 During particularly strong space weather events such as high solar winds or large CMEs, Earth's magnetic field is disturbed and geomagnetic storms can penetrate the magnetosphere and lead to widespread 
radio and power blackouts as well as endangering astronauts and Earth-orbiting satellites. ,
 In 1859, a large solar storm known as the Carrington Event caused widespread telegraph system failures and in 1989, a CME accompanied a solar flare and plunged the entire province of Quebec, Canada into 
an electrical blackout that lasted around 12 hours according to a NASA statement (opens in new tab).,
 The degree of magnetic disturbance from a CME depends on the CME's magnetic field and Earth's. If the CME's magnetic field is aligned with Earth's, pointing from south to north the CME will pass on by 
with little effect. However, if the CME is aligned in the opposite direction it can cause Earth's magnetic field to be reorganized, (opens in new tab) triggering large geomagnetic storms. ,
 A less destructive and far prettier side effect of magnetosphere disturbances is the aurora above Earth's polar regions. The phenomenon is known as the northern lights (aurora borealis) in the Northern 
Hemisphere and the southern lights (aurora australis) in the Southern Hemisphere. ,
 According to Science Daily (opens in new tab), in the last 200 million years alone, Earth's magnetic poles have reversed hundreds of times in a process where north becomes south and south becomes north. 
,
 The magnetic poles flip approximately every 200,000 to 300,000 years (opens in new tab) according to NASA, though it has been more than twice that long since the last reversal. Earth's most recent magnetic 
reversal occurred approximately 790,000 years ago so we are rather overdue for another. But don't worry, the magnetic poles won't just switch overnight, it can take hundreds or even thousands of years 
for the poles to flip.  ,
 Earth is not the only planet in the solar system to possess a magnetic field. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all exhibit magnetic fields far stronger than Earth's, according to Union University (opens 
in new tab), though the underlying mechanisms driving these magnetic fields are not yet completely understood. ,
 Not every planet is fortunate enough to have a protective magnetic layer. Mars does not have enough inner heat nor does it possess the liquid interior required to generate a magnetic field. Venus, on 
the other hand, has a liquid core but does not spin fast enough to generate a magnetic field. ,

and also holds a Master's in Environmental Science, she is currently based in Nottingham, U.K.,
 Earth's magnetic field, also known as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from Earth's interior out into space, where it interacts with the solar wind, a stream of charged particles 
emanating from the Sun. The magnetic field is generated by electric currents due to the motion of convection currents of a mixture of molten iron and nickel in Earth's outer core: these convection currents 
are caused by heat escaping from the core, a natural process called a geodynamo. ,
 The magnitude of Earth's magnetic field  at its surface ranges from 25 to 65 μT (0.25 to 0.65 G).[3] As an approximation, it is represented by a field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle 
of about 11° with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were an enormous bar magnet placed at that angle through the center of Earth. The North geomagnetic pole actually represents the South 
pole of Earth's magnetic field, and conversely the South geomagnetic pole corresponds to the north pole of Earth's magnetic field (because opposite magnetic poles attract and the north end of a magnet, 
like a compass needle, points toward Earth's South magnetic field, i.e., the North geomagnetic pole near the Geographic North Pole). As of 2015, the North geomagnetic pole was located on Ellesmere Island, 
Nunavut, Canada.,
 While the North and South magnetic poles are usually located near the geographic poles, they slowly and continuously move over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to 
remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, Earth's field reverses and the North and South Magnetic Poles respectively, abruptly switch places. 
These reversals of the geomagnetic poles leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the 
motions of continents and ocean floors in the process of plate tectonics.,
 The magnetosphere is the region above the ionosphere that is defined by the extent of Earth's magnetic field in space. It extends several tens of thousands of kilometres into space, protecting Earth from 
the charged particles of the solar wind and cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere, including the ozone layer that protects Earth from the harmful ultraviolet radiation.,
 Earth's magnetic field deflects most of the solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.[4] One stripping 
mechanism is for gas to be caught in bubbles of magnetic field, which are ripped off by solar winds.[5] Calculations of the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars, resulting from scavenging 
of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere.[6][7],
 The study of the past magnetic field of the Earth is known as paleomagnetism.[8] The polarity of the Earth's magnetic field is recorded in igneous rocks, and reversals of the field are thus detectable 
as \stripes\ centered on mid-ocean ridges where the sea floor is spreading, while the stability of the geomagnetic poles between reversals has allowed paleomagnetism to track the past motion of continents. 
Reversals also provide the basis for magnetostratigraphy, a way of dating rocks and sediments.[9] The field also magnetizes the crust, and magnetic anomalies can be used to search for deposits of metal 
ores.[10],
 Humans have used compasses for direction finding since the 11th century A.D. and for navigation since the 12th century.[11] Although the magnetic declination does shift with time, this wandering is slow 
enough that a simple compass can remain useful for navigation. Using magnetoreception,  various other organisms, ranging from some types of bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation 
and navigation.,
 At any location, the Earth's magnetic field can be represented by a three-dimensional vector. A typical procedure for measuring its direction is to use a compass to determine the direction of magnetic 
North. Its angle relative to true North is the declination (D) or variation. Facing magnetic North, the angle the field makes with the horizontal is the inclination (I) or magnetic dip. The intensity (F) 
of the field is proportional to the force it exerts on a magnet. Another common representation is in X (North), Y (East) and Z (Down) coordinates.[12],
 The intensity of the field is often measured in gauss (G), but is generally reported in microteslas (μT), with 1 G = 100 μT. A nanotesla is also referred to as a gamma (γ). The Earth's field ranges between 
approximately 25 and 65 μT (0.25 and 0.65 G).[13] By comparison, a strong refrigerator magnet has a field of about 10,000 μT (100 G).[14],
 A map of intensity contours is called an isodynamic chart. As the World Magnetic Model shows, the intensity tends to decrease from the poles to the equator. A minimum intensity occurs in the South Atlantic 
Anomaly over South America while there are maxima over northern Canada, Siberia, and the coast of Antarctica south of Australia.[15],
 The intensity of the magnetic field is subject to change over time. A 2021 paleomagnetic study from the University of Liverpool contributed to a growing body of evidence that the Earth's magnetic field 
cycles with intensity every 200 million years. The lead author stated that \Our findings, when considered alongside the existing datasets, support the existence of an approximately 200-million-year-long 
cycle in the strength of the Earth's magnetic field related to deep Earth processes.\[16],
 The inclination is given by an angle that can assume values between -90° (up) to 90° (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the North Magnetic Pole and 
rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0°) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination can be measured 
with a dip circle.,
 Declination is positive for an eastward deviation of the field relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north–south heading on a compass with the direction of a celestial 
pole. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be 
represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).,
 Near the surface of the Earth, its magnetic field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned at the center of the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to 
the rotational axis of the Earth.[13] The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole.[17] This may seem surprising, but the north 
pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and 
repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.[12],
 Historically, the north and south poles of a magnet were first defined by the Earth's magnetic field, not vice versa, since one of the first uses for a magnet was as a compass needle. A magnet's  North 
pole is defined as the pole that is attracted by the Earth's North Magnetic Pole when the magnet is suspended so it can turn freely. Since opposite poles attract, the North Magnetic Pole of the Earth is 
really the south pole of its magnetic field (the place where the field is directed downward into the Earth).[18][19][20][21],
 The positions of the magnetic poles can be defined in at least two ways: locally or globally.[22] The local definition is the point where the magnetic field is vertical.[23] This can be determined by 
measuring the inclination. The inclination of the Earth's field is 90° (downwards) at the North Magnetic Pole and -90° (upwards) at the South Magnetic Pole. The two poles wander independently of each other 
and are not directly opposite each other on the globe.  Movements of up to 40 kilometres (25 mi) per year have been observed for the North Magnetic Pole. Over the last 180 years, the North Magnetic Pole 
has been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the Boothia Peninsula in 1831 to 600 kilometres (370 mi) from Resolute Bay in 2001.[24] The magnetic equator is the line where the inclination is 
zero (the magnetic field is horizontal).,
 The global definition of the Earth's field is based on a mathematical model. If a line is drawn through the center of the Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions 
where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide 
and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.,
 Earth's magnetic field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted further out by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving the Sun's corona and accelerating to a speed of 
200 to 1000 kilometres per second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).[25],
 The solar wind exerts a pressure, and if it could reach Earth's atmosphere it would erode it. However, it is kept away by the pressure of the Earth's magnetic field. The magnetopause, the area where the 
pressures balance, is the boundary of the magnetosphere. Despite its name, the magnetosphere is asymmetric, with the sunward side being about 10 Earth radii out but the other side stretching out in a magnetotail 
that extends beyond 200 Earth radii.[26]Sunward of the magnetopause is the bow shock, the area where the solar wind slows abruptly.[25],
 Inside the magnetosphere is the plasmasphere, a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or plasma. This region begins at a height of 60 km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes 
the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth.[26] There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the Van Allen radiation belts, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10 MeV). The 
inner belt is 1–2 Earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4–7 Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.[27],

 As well as deflecting the solar wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects cosmic rays, high-energy charged particles that are mostly from outside the Solar System. Many cosmic rays are kept out of the 
Solar System by the Sun's magnetosphere, or heliosphere.[28] By contrast, astronauts on the Moon risk exposure to radiation. Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar 
eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.[25],
 Some of the charged particles do get into the magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing back and forth between the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift 
westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface.[25] Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the 
atoms there give rise to the lights of the aurorae and also emit X-rays.[26],
 The varying conditions in the magnetosphere, known as space weather, are largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the 
magnetosphere and more of it gets in. Periods of particularly intense activity, called geomagnetic storms, can occur when a coronal mass ejection erupts above the Sun and sends a shock wave through the 
Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the Earth. Geomagnetic storms can cause a lot of disruption; the \Halloween\ storm of 2003 damaged more than a third of NASA's satellites. The 
largest documented storm, the Carrington Event, occurred in 1859. It induced currents strong enough to disrupt telegraph lines, and aurorae were reported as far south as Hawaii.[25][29],
 The geomagnetic field changes on time scales from milliseconds to millions of years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere (ionospheric dynamo region) and magnetosphere, and 
some changes can be traced to geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents. Changes over time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the Earth's interior, particularly the iron-rich core.[12],

 Data from THEMIS show that the magnetic field, which interacts with the solar wind, is reduced when the magnetic orientation is aligned between Sun and Earth – opposite to the previous hypothesis. During 
forthcoming solar storms, this could result in blackouts and disruptions in artificial satellites.[31],
 Changes in Earth's magnetic field on a time scale of a year or more are referred to as secular variation. Over hundreds of years, magnetic declination is observed to vary over tens of degrees.[12] The 
animation shows how global declinations have changed over the last few centuries.[32],
 The direction and intensity of the dipole change over time. Over the last two centuries the dipole strength has been decreasing at a rate of about 6.3% per century.[12] At this rate of decrease, the field 
would be negligible in about 1600 years.[33] However, this strength is about average for the last 7 thousand years, and the current rate of change is not unusual.[34],
 A prominent feature in the non-dipolar part of the secular variation is a westward drift at a rate of about 0.2° per year.[33] This drift is not the same everywhere and has varied over time. The globally 
averaged drift has been westward since about 1400 AD but eastward between about 1000 AD and 1400 AD.[35],
 Changes that predate magnetic observatories are recorded in archaeological and geological materials. Such changes are referred to as paleomagnetic secular variation or paleosecular variation (PSV). The 
records typically include long periods of small change with occasional large changes reflecting geomagnetic excursions and reversals.[36],
 In July 2020 scientists report that analysis of simulations and a recent observational field model show that maximum rates of directional change of Earth's magnetic field reached ~10° per year – almost 
100 times faster than current changes and 10 times faster than previously thought.[37][38],
 Studies of lava flows on Steens Mountain, Oregon, indicate that the magnetic field could have shifted at a rate of up to 6° per day at some time in Earth's history, which significantly challenges the 
popular understanding of how the Earth's magnetic field works.[39] This finding was later attributed to unusual rock magnetic properties of the lava flow under study, not rapid field change, by one of 
the original authors of the 1995 study.[40],
 Although generally Earth's field is approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly aligned with the rotational axis, occasionally the North and South geomagnetic poles trade places. Evidence for these 
geomagnetic reversals can be found in basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies.[41] Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals 
ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred about 780,000 years ago.[24][42] A related 
phenomenon, a geomagnetic excursion, takes the dipole axis across the equator and then back to the original polarity.[43][44] The Laschamp event is an example of an excursion, occurring during the last 
ice age (41,000 years ago).,
 The past magnetic field is recorded mostly by strongly magnetic minerals, particularly iron oxides such as magnetite, that can carry a permanent magnetic moment. This remanent magnetization, or remanence, 
can be acquired in more than one way. In lava flows, the direction of the field is \frozen\ in small minerals as they cool, giving rise to a thermoremanent magnetization. In sediments, the orientation 
of magnetic particles acquires a slight bias towards the magnetic field as they are deposited on an ocean floor or lake bottom. This is called detrital remanent magnetization.[8],
 Thermoremanent magnetization is the main source of the magnetic anomalies around mid-ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, magma wells up from the mantle, cools to form new basaltic crust on both sides 
of the ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. 
The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below. This 
provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.[8],
 Radiometric dating of lava flows has been used to establish a geomagnetic polarity time scale, part of which is shown in the image. This forms the basis of magnetostratigraphy, a geophysical correlation 
technique that can be used to date both sedimentary and volcanic sequences as well as the seafloor magnetic anomalies.[8],
 Starting in the late 1800s and throughout the 1900s and later, the overall geomagnetic field has become weaker; the present strong deterioration corresponds to a 10–15% decline and has accelerated since 
2000; geomagnetic intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum 35% above the modern value, from circa year 1 AD. The rate of decrease and the current strength are within the normal range of 
variation, as shown by the record of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks.,
 The nature of Earth's magnetic field is one of heteroscedastic (seemingly random) fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, 
are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone up and down in the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) 
is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the 
same or increases.,
 The Earth's magnetic north pole is drifting from northern Canada towards Siberia with a presently accelerating rate—10 kilometres (6.2 mi) per year at the beginning of the 1900s, up to 40 kilometres (25 
mi) per year in 2003,[24] and since then has only accelerated.[48][49],
 The Earth's magnetic field is believed to be generated by electric currents in the conductive iron alloys of its core, created by convection currents due to heat escaping from the core.,
 The Earth and most of the planets in the Solar System, as well as the Sun and other stars, all generate magnetic fields through the motion of electrically conducting fluids.[51] The Earth's field originates 
in its core. This is a region of iron alloys extending to about 3400 km (the radius of the Earth is 6370 km). It is divided into a solid inner core, with a radius of 1220 km, and a liquid outer core.[52] 
The motion of the liquid in the outer core is driven by heat flow from the inner core, which is about 6,000 K (5,730 °C; 10,340 °F), to the core-mantle boundary, which is about 3,800 K (3,530 °C; 6,380 
°F).[53]  The heat is generated by potential energy released by heavier materials sinking toward the core (planetary differentiation, the iron catastrophe) as well as decay of radioactive elements in the 
interior.  The pattern of flow is organized by the rotation of the Earth and the presence of the solid inner core.[54],
 The mechanism by which the Earth generates a magnetic field is known as a dynamo.[51] The magnetic field is generated by a feedback loop: current loops generate magnetic fields (Ampère's circuital law); 
a changing magnetic field generates an electric field (Faraday's law); and the electric and magnetic fields exert a force on the charges that are flowing in currents (the Lorentz force).[55] These effects 
can be combined in a partial differential equation for the magnetic field called the magnetic induction equation,,
 where u is the velocity of the fluid; B is the magnetic B-field; and η=1/σμ is the magnetic diffusivity, which is inversely proportional to the product of the electrical conductivity σ and the permeability 
μ .[56]  The term ∂B/∂t is the time derivative of the field; ∇2 is the Laplace operator and ∇× is the curl operator.,
 The first term on the right hand side of the induction equation is a diffusion term. In a stationary fluid, the magnetic field declines and any concentrations of field spread out. If the Earth's dynamo 
shut off, the dipole part would disappear in a few tens of thousands of years.[56],
 In a perfect conductor (                    σ        =        ∞                      {\\displaystyle \\sigma =\\infty \\;}  ), there would be no diffusion. By Lenz's law, any change in the magnetic field 
would be immediately opposed by currents, so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change. As the fluid moved, the magnetic field would go with it. The theorem describing this effect is called 
the frozen-in-field theorem. Even in a fluid with a finite conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating 
new field indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it resists fluid motion.[56],
 The motion of the fluid is sustained by convection, motion driven by buoyancy. The temperature increases towards the center of the Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. 
This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making 
it lighter. This is called compositional convection. A Coriolis effect, caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north–south polar axis.[54][56],

 A dynamo can amplify a magnetic field, but it needs a \seed\ field to get it started.[56] For the Earth, this could have been an external magnetic field. Early in its history the Sun went through a T-Tauri 
phase in which the solar wind would have had a magnetic field orders of magnitude larger than the present solar wind.[57] However, much of the field may have been screened out by the Earth's mantle. An 
alternative source is currents in the core-mantle boundary driven by chemical reactions or variations in thermal or electric conductivity. Such effects may still provide a small bias that are part of the 
boundary conditions for the geodynamo.[58],
 Simulating the geodynamo by computer requires numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations 
is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating 
kinematic dynamo computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and the effect on the magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries 
and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.[60],
 The first self-consistent dynamo models, ones that determine both the fluid motions and the magnetic field, were developed by two groups in 1995, one in Japan[61] and one in the United States.[1][62] 
The latter received attention because it successfully reproduced some of the characteristics of the Earth's field, including geomagnetic reversals.[60],
 The oceans contribute to Earth's magnetic field. Seawater is an electrical conductor, and therefore interacts with the magnetic field. As the tides cycle around the ocean basins, the ocean water essentially 
tries to pull the geomagnetic field lines along. Because the salty water is slightly conductive, the interaction is relatively weak: the strongest component is from the regular lunar tide that happens 
about twice per day (M2). Other contributions come from ocean swell, eddies, and even tsunamis.[63],
 The strength of the interaction depends also on the temperature of the ocean water. The entire heat stored in the ocean can now be inferred from observations of the Earth's magnetic field.[64][63],
 Electric currents induced in the ionosphere generate magnetic fields (ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated near where the atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations 
that can deflect surface magnetic fields by as much as 1°. Typical daily variations of field strength are about 25 nT (one part in 2000), with variations over a few seconds of typically around 1 nT (one 
part in 50,000).[65],
 The Earth's magnetic field strength was measured by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1832[66] and has been repeatedly measured since then, showing a relative decay of about 10% over the last 150 years.[67] The 
Magsat satellite and later satellites have used 3-axis vector magnetometers to probe the 3-D structure of the Earth's magnetic field. The later Ørsted satellite allowed a comparison indicating a dynamic 
geodynamo in action that appears to be giving rise to an alternate pole under the Atlantic Ocean west of South Africa.[68],
 Governments sometimes operate units that specialize in measurement of the Earth's magnetic field. These are geomagnetic observatories, typically part of a national Geological survey, for example, the 
British Geological Survey's Eskdalemuir Observatory. Such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms that sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other 
human activities.,
 The military determines local geomagnetic field characteristics, in order to detect anomalies in the natural background that might be caused by a significant metallic object such as a submerged submarine. 
Typically, these magnetic anomaly detectors are flown in aircraft like the UK's Nimrod or towed as an instrument or an array of instruments from surface ships.,
 Magnetometers detect minute deviations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by iron artifacts, kilns, some types of stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic 
instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines,[70] the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, 
volcanic rock making up the ocean floor[71] — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners as early as 
the late 18th century.[72] More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean 
floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.[72],
 Each measurement of the magnetic field is at a particular place and time. If an accurate estimate of the field at some other place and time is needed, the measurements must be converted to a model and 
the model used to make predictions.,
 The most common way of analyzing the global variations in the Earth's magnetic field is to fit the measurements to a set of spherical harmonics. This was first done by Carl Friedrich Gauss.[73] Spherical 
harmonics are functions that oscillate over the surface of a sphere. They are the product of two functions, one that depends on latitude and one on longitude. The function of longitude is zero along zero 
or more great circles passing through the North and South Poles; the number of such nodal lines is the absolute value of the order m. The function of latitude is zero along zero or more latitude circles; 
this plus the order is equal to the degree ℓ. Each harmonic is equivalent to a particular arrangement of magnetic charges at the center of the Earth. A monopole is an isolated magnetic charge, which has 
never been observed. A dipole is equivalent to two opposing charges brought close together and a quadrupole to two dipoles brought together. A quadrupole field is shown in the lower figure on the right.[12],

 Spherical harmonics can represent any scalar field (function of position) that satisfies certain properties. A magnetic field is a vector field, but if it is expressed in Cartesian components X, Y, Z, 
each component is the derivative of the same scalar function called the magnetic potential. Analyses of the Earth's magnetic field use a modified version of the usual spherical harmonics that differ by 
a multiplicative factor. A least-squares fit to the magnetic field measurements gives the Earth's field as the sum of spherical harmonics, each multiplied by the best-fitting  Gauss coefficient gmℓ or 
hmℓ.[12],
 The lowest-degree Gauss coefficient, g00, gives the contribution of an isolated magnetic charge, so it is zero. The next three coefficients – g10, g11, and h11 – determine the direction and magnitude 
of the dipole contribution. The best fitting dipole is tilted at an angle of about 10° with respect to the rotational axis, as described earlier.[12],
 Spherical harmonic analysis can be used to distinguish internal from external sources if measurements are available at more than one height (for example, ground observatories and satellites). In that 
case, each term with coefficient gmℓ or hmℓ can be split into two terms: one that decreases with radius as 1/rℓ+1 and one that increases with radius as rℓ. The increasing terms fit the external sources 
(currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere). However, averaged over a few years the external contributions average to zero.[12],
 The remaining terms predict that the potential of a dipole source (ℓ=1) drops off as 1/r2. The magnetic field, being a derivative of the potential, drops off as 1/r3. Quadrupole terms drop off as 1/r4, 
and higher order terms drop off increasingly rapidly with the radius. The radius of the outer core is about half of the radius of the Earth. If the field at the core-mantle boundary is fit to spherical 
harmonics, the dipole part is smaller by a factor of about 8 at the surface, the quadrupole part by a factor of 16, and so on. Thus, only the components with large wavelengths can be noticeable at the 
surface. From a variety of arguments, it is usually assumed that only terms up to degree 14 or less have their origin in the core. These have wavelengths of about 2,000 km (1,200 mi) or less. Smaller features 
are attributed to crustal anomalies.[12],
 The International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy maintains a standard global field model called the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF). It is updated every five years. The 11th-generation 
model, IGRF11, was developed using data from satellites (Ørsted, CHAMP and SAC-C) and a world network of geomagnetic observatories.[74] The spherical harmonic expansion was truncated at degree 10, with 
120 coefficients, until 2000. Subsequent models are truncated at degree 13 (195 coefficients).[75],
 Another global field model, called the World Magnetic Model, is produced jointly by the United States National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly the National Geophysical Data Center) and 
the British Geological Survey. This model truncates at degree 12 (168 coefficients) with an approximate spatial resolution of 3,000 kilometers. It is the model used by the United States Department of Defense, 
the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom), the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the International Hydrographic Organization as well 
as in many civilian navigation systems.[76],
 The above models only take into account the \main field\ at the core-mantle boundary. Although generally good enough for navigation, higher-accuracy use cases require smaller-scale magnetic anomalies 
and other variations to be considered. Some examples are (see geomag.us ref for more):[77],
 For historical data about the main field, the IGRF may be used back to year 1900.[75] A specialized GUFM1 model estimates back to year 1590 using ship's logs.[80] Paleomagnetic research has produced models 
dating back to 10,000 BCE.[81],
 Animals, including birds and turtles, can detect the Earth's magnetic field, and use the field to navigate during migration.[82] Some researchers have found that cows and wild deer tend to align their 
bodies north–south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible.[83][84] Other researchers reported in 2011 that they could not 
replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.[85],
 Very weak electromagnetic fields disrupt the magnetic compass used by European robins and other songbirds, which use the Earth's magnetic field to navigate. Neither power lines nor cellphone signals are 
to blame for the electromagnetic field effect on the birds;[86] instead, the culprits have frequencies between 2 kHz and 5 MHz. These include AM radio signals and ordinary electronic equipment that might 
be found in businesses or private homes.[87],
 Ionospheric scintillation is the rapid modification of radio waves caused by small scale structures in the ionosphere. Severe scintillation conditions can prevent a GPS receiver from locking on to the 
signal and can make it impossible to calculate a position. Less severe scintillation conditions can reduce the accuracy and the confidence of positioning results.,
 Scintillation of radio waves impacts the power and phase of the radio signal. Scintillation is caused by small-scale (tens of meters to tens of km) structure in the ionospheric electron density along 
the signal path and is the result of interference of refracted and/or diffracted (scattered) waves. Scintillation is usually quantified by two indexes: S4 for amplitude scintillation and σφ (sigma-phi) 
for phase scintillation. The indexes reflect the variability of the signal over a period of time, usually one minute. Scintillation is more prevalent at low and high latitudes, but mid-latitudes, such 
as the United States, experience scintillation much less frequently. Scintillation is a strong function of local time, season, geomagnetic activity, and solar cycle but it also influenced by waves propagating 
from the lower atmosphere.,
 The Earth's magnetic field is similar tothat of a bar magnettilted 11 degrees from thespin axis of the Earth. The problemwith that pictureis that the Curie temperature of iron is about 770 C . The Earth's 
coreis hotter than that and therefore not magnetic. So how did the Earth get its magnetic field? ,
  Magnetic fields surround electric currents, so we surmise that circulating electic currents in the Earth's molten metalic core are the origin of the magnetic field. A current loop gives a field similar 
to that of the earth.  The magnetic field magnitude measured at the surface of the Earth is about half a Gauss and dips toward the Earth in the northern hemisphere. The magnitude varies over the surface 
of the Earth in the range 0.3 to 0.6 Gauss. ,
 The Earth's magnetic field is attributed to a dynamo effect of circulating electric current, but it is not constant in direction. Rock specimens of different age in similar locations have different directions 
of permanent magnetization. Evidence for 171 magnetic field reversals during the past 71 million years has been reported. ,
  Although the details of the dynamo effect are not known in detail, the rotation of the Earth plays a part in generating the currents which are presumed to be the source of the magnetic field. Mariner 
2 found that Venus does not have such a magnetic field although its core iron content must be similar to that of the Earth. Venus's rotation period of 243 Earth days is just too slow to produce the dynamo 
effect.,
  The simple question \how does the Earth get its magnetic field?\ does not have a simple answer. It does seem clear that the generation of the magnetic field is linked to the rotation of the earth, since 
Venus with a similar iron-core composition but a 243 Earth-day rotation period does not have a measurable magnetic field. It certainly seems plausible that it depends upon the rotation of the fluid metallic 
iron which makes up a large portion of the interior, and the rotating conductor model leads to the term \dynamo effect\ or \geodynamo\, evoking the image of an electric generator. ,
  Convection drives the outer-core fluid and it circulates relative to the earth. This means the electrically conducting material moves relative to the earth's magnetic field. If it can obtain a charge 
by some interaction like friction between layers, an effective current loop could be produced. The magnetic field of a current loop could sustain the magnetic dipole type magnetic field of the earth. Large-scale 
computer models are approaching a realistic simulation of such a geodynamo. ,
 Bjornerud tells the story of U.S. Navy vessels towing sensitive magnetometers across the ocean floor in the 1950s as a part of a \cold war\ strategy of finding ways of detecting Soviet submarines and 
concealing theirs. ,
 When the normal magnetic field of the Earth was subtracted, there were variations on the order of 10% from the magnetism of the sea floor rocks which showed reversals of direction. ,
 The graphic above from the USGS shows the pattern of reversals out to about 4Myr as determined by potassium-argon dating. This set of measurements in opposite directions from the East Pacific Rise shows 
remarkable symmetry and contributes to our picture of plate tectonics. ,
 Radiation belts are regions of enhanced populations of energetic electrons and protons surrounding the Earth in space. These belts are highly dynamic, increasing and decreasing on time scales of minutes 
to years. The high levels of radiation caused by the energetic electrons and protons makes this a very harsh region for satellites.,
 Earth’s radiation belts, discovered shortly after the launch of the first US satellite in 1958, were one of the earliest discoveries of the space age. Since that time, while many satellites have made 
observations as they pass through the belts, much is still not understood about the processes that cause the energization, transport and loss of radiation belt particles.,
 There is a good understanding of the typical properties of the radiation belts, though, including their location and some of the processes that control the radiation belt intensity and variability. Radiation 
belt particle motion and dynamics are controlled to a great extent by the magnetic and electric fields in space and how these fields vary as a result of the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth’s 
magnetic and plasma environment. Electrons with typical energies above 0.1 Million electron volts (MeV) are found in both an inner belt (from about 1.5 to 3 Re (earth radii) above Earth’s center in the 
equatorial plane), and an outer belt (from about 3-10 Re). The so-called “slot region” forms between the two electron belts as a result of losses due to electron interactions with electromagnetic waves 
called whistlers. The radial location and intensity of the electron radiation belts are extremely variable, and predicting this variability is one of the major challenges for space weather forecasters. 
High-energy protons, with typical energies greater than 10 MeV, form one belt that extends from about 1.1 to 3 Earth radii.,
 The energetic particles that comprise the radiation belts can be hazardous for satellites and astronauts in space and can also have effects on Earth’s ionosphere and upper atmosphere. For example, high 
energy radiation belt protons, and even higher energy galactic cosmic rays, can alter the electronic state of sensitive electronic devices on satellites, resulting in computer errors or failures. In the 
case of high-energy electrons, they can cause serious damage to satellite cables and computer chips through a process called deep dielectric charging that culminates in harmful discharges. When MeV electrons 
precipitate into Earth’s upper atmosphere, they can deplete ozone and affect chemical processes in the atmosphere.,
 The solar wind continuously flows outward from the Sun and consists mainly of protons and electrons in a state known as a plasma. Solar magnetic field is embedded in the plasma and flows outward with 
the solar wind. ,
 Different regions on the Sun produce solar wind of different speeds and densities.  Coronal holes produce solar wind of high speed, ranging from 500 to 800 kilometers per second.  The north and south 
poles of the Sun have large, persistent coronal holes, so high latitudes are filled with fast solar wind.  In the equatorial plane, where the Earth and the other planets orbit, the most common state of 
the solar wind is the slow speed wind, with speeds of about 400 kilometers per second. This portion of the solar wind forms the equatorial current sheet.  ,
 During quiet periods, the current sheet can be nearly flat. As solar activity increases, the solar surface fills with active regions, coronal holes, and other complex structures, which modify the solar 
wind and current sheet. Because the Sun rotates every 27 days, the solar wind becomes a complex spiral of high and low speeds and high and low densities that looks like the skirt of a twirling ballerina 
(see figure). When high speed solar overtakes slow speed wind, it creates something known as a corotating interaction region. These interaction regions consist of solar wind with very high densities and 
strong magnetic fields,
 Above the current sheet, the higher speed solar wind typically has a dominant magnetic polarity in one direction and below the current sheet, the polarity is in the opposite direction.  As the Earth moves 
through this evolving ballerina skirt, it is sometimes within the heliospheric current sheet, sometimes above it and sometime below it. When the magnetic field of the solar wind switches polarity, it is 
a strong indication that Earth has crossed the current sheet. The location of the Earth with respect to the current sheet is important because space weather impacts are highly dependent on the solar wind 
speed, the solar wind density, and the direction of the magnetic field embedded in the solar wind.    ,
 Each of the elements mentioned above play a role in space weather. High speed winds bring geomagnetic storms while slow speed winds bring calm space weather. Corotating interaction regions and to a lesser 
extent, current sheet crossings, can also cause geomagnetic disturbances. Thus specifying and forecasting the solar wind is critical to developing forecasts of space weather and its impacts at Earth.,

 Sunspots are dark areas that become apparent at the Sun’s photosphere as a result of intense magnetic flux pushing up from further within the solar interior. Areas along this magnetic flux in the upper 
photosphere and chromosphere heat up, and usually become visible as faculae and plage – often times termed active regions. This causes cooler (7000 F), less dense and darker areas at the heart of these 
magnetic fields than in the surrounding photosphere (10,000 F) - seen as sunspots. Active regions associated with sunspot groups are usually visible as bright enhancements in the corona at EUV and X-ray 
wavelengths. Rapid changes in the magnetic field alignment of sunspot groups’ associated active regions are the most likely sources of significant space weather events such as solar flares, CMEs, radiations 
storms, and radio bursts.,
 Sunspots appear in a wide variety of shapes and forms. The darkest area of a sunspot (also the first to be observed) is called the umbrae. As the sunspot matures (becomes more intense), a less dark, outlying 
area of well-defined fibril-like structure develops around the umbrae - called penumbra. Sunspots can grow from an individual unipolar spot into more organized bipolar spot groups; or even evolve into 
immense, very complex sunspot groups with mixed magnetic polarities throughout the group. The largest sunspot groups can cover large swaths of the Sun’s surface and be many times the size of Earth.,
 Sunspot groups that are clearly visible and observed by designated ground-based observatories, are assigned a NOAA/SWPC 4-digit region number to officially record and track the sunspot group as it rotates 
across the visible solar disk. Sunspot groups are analyzed and characterized based on their size and complexity by SWPC forecasters each day using the modified Zurich classification scale and Mount Wilson 
magnetic classification system. This daily sunspot analysis and classification is submitted at the end of each UTC-day as the Solar Region Summary report.,
 Sunspots can change continuously and may last for only a few hours to days; or even months for the more intense groups. The total number of sunspots has long been known to vary with an approximately 11-year 
repetition known as the solar cycle. The peak of sunspot activity is known as solar maximum and the lull is known as solar minimum. Solar cycles started being assigned consecutive numbers. This number 
assignment began with solar cycle 1 in 1755 and the most recent being cycle 24 – which began in December, 2008 and is now nearing solar minimum. A new solar cycle is considered to have begun when sunspot 
groups emerge at higher latitudes with the magnetic polarities of the leading spots opposite that of the previous cycle. A plot of sunspot number progression for the previous and current solar cycle, and 
that compares the observed and smoothed values with the official sunspot number forecast provided by the Solar Cycle Prediction Panel representing NOAA, the International Space Environmental Services (ISES), 
and NASA is available to view on our SWPC webpage at solar cycle progression.,
 The official daily and monthly sunspot numbers are determined by the World Data Center – Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (WDC-SILSO) at the Royal Observatory of Belgium. Generally, sunspot 
reports from observatories calculate sunspot numbers whereby each sunspot group counts as 10, and every umbra within each spot group is individually considered as 1. Therefore, no sunspots on the visible 
Sun would be considered as zero; while the next possible number can only be 11 or higher.,
 More detailed information about sunspot number concepts and a thorough perspective about the solar cycle, can be learned by reading the scientific paper: “Revisiting the Sunspot Number, a 400-year perspective 
on the Solar Cycle” by F. Clette, L. Svalgaard, J. Vaquero, and E. Cliver; Space Sci Rev (2014) 186:35-103; DOI 10.1007/s11214-014-0074-2,
 Magnetic fields can be measured in various ways. The simplest measurement technique still employed today involves the use of the compass, a device consisting of a permanently magnetized needle that is 
balanced to pivot in the horizontal plane. In the presence of a magnetic field and in the absence of gravity, a magnetized needle aligns itself exactly along the magnetic field vector. When balanced on 
a pivot in the presence of gravity, it becomes aligned with a component of the field. In the conventional compass, this is the horizontal component. A magnetized needle may also be pivoted and balanced 
about a horizontal axis. If this device, called a dip meter, is first aligned in the direction of the magnetic meridian as defined by a compass, the needle lines up with the total field vector and measures 
the inclination angle I. Finally, it is possible to measure the magnitude of the horizontal field by the oscillations of the compass needle. It can be shown that the period of such an oscillation depends 
on properties of the needle and the strength of the field.,
 Magnetic observatories continuously measure and record Earth’s magnetic field at a number of locations. In an observatory of this sort, magnetized needles with reflecting mirrors are suspended by quartz 
fibres. Light beams reflected from the mirrors are imaged on a photographic negative mounted on a rotating drum. Variations in the field cause corresponding deflections on the negative. Typical scale factors 
for such observatories correspond to 2–10 nanoteslas per millimetre vertically and 20 millimetres per hour horizontally. A print of the developed negative is called a magnetogram.,
 Magnetic observatories have recorded data in this manner for well over 100 years. Their magnetograms are photographed on microfilm and submitted to world data centres, where they are available for scientific 
or practical use. Such applications include the creation of world magnetic maps for navigation and surveying; correction of data obtained in air, land, and sea surveys for mineral and oil deposits; and 
scientific studies of the interaction of the Sun with Earth.,
 In recent years other methods of measuring magnetic fields have proved more convenient, and older instruments are gradually being replaced. One such method involves the proton-precession magnetometer, 
which makes use of the magnetic and gyroscopic properties of protons in a fluid such as gasoline. In this method the magnetic moments of protons are first aligned by a strong magnetic field produced by 
an external coil. The magnetic field is then turned off abruptly, and the protons try to align themselves with Earth’s field. However, since the protons are spinning as well as magnetized, they precess 
around Earth’s field with a frequency dependent on the magnitude of the latter. The external coil senses a weak voltage induced by this gyration. The period of gyration is determined electronically with 
sufficient accuracy to yield a sensitivity between 0.1 and 1.0 nanotesla.,
 An instrument that complements the proton-precession magnetometer is the flux-gate magnetometer. In contrast to the proton-precession magnetometer, the flux-gate device measures the three components of 
the field vector rather than its magnitude. It employs three sensors, each aligned with one of the three components of the field vector. Each sensor is constructed from a transformer wound around a core 
of high-permeability material (e.g., mu-metal). The primary winding of the transformer is excited with a high-frequency (about 5 kilohertz) sine wave. In the absence of any field along the transformer 
axis, the output signal in the secondary winding consists of only odd harmonics (component frequencies) of the drive frequency. If, however, a field is present, it biases the hysteresis loop for the core 
in one direction. This causes the core to become saturated sooner in one half of a drive cycle than in the other. This in turn causes the secondary voltage to include all even harmonics as well as odd. 
The amplitude and phase of the even harmonics are linearly proportional to the component of the field along the axis of the transformer.,
 Most modern magnetic observatories have both a proton-precession magnetometer and a flux-gate magnetometer mounted on granite pillars in nonmagnetic, temperature-controlled rooms. The outputs from the 
instruments are electrical signals, and they are digitized and recorded on magnetic media. Many observatories also transmit their data soon after acquisition to central facilities, where they are stored 
with data from other locations in a large computer database.,
 Magnetic measurements are often made at locations remote from fixed observatories. Such measurements are commonly part of a survey designed to better define Earth’s main field or to detect anomalies in 
it. Surveys of this type are routinely carried out by foot, ship, aircraft, and spacecraft. For surveys near Earth’s surface the proton-precession magnetometer is almost always used because it does not 
need to be precisely aligned. Above Earth’s surface the main field decreases rapidly, and the need for precise alignment is less severe. Thus, flux-gate magnetometers are generally employed on spacecraft. 
Calculation of components of the vector field in a coordinate system fixed with respect to Earth requires knowledge of the location and orientation of the spacecraft.,
 To a first approximation the magnetic field observed at the surface of Earth is like that of a magnet aligned with the planet’s rotation axis. The figure shows such a field for a bar magnet located at 
the centre of a sphere. If the sphere is taken to be Earth with the north geographic pole at the top of the diagram, the magnet must be oriented with its north magnetic pole downward toward the south geographic 
pole. Then, as shown in the diagram, magnetic field lines leave the north pole of the magnet and curve around until they cross Earth’s Equator pointing geographically northward. They curve still more reentering 
Earth in northern latitudes, finally returning to the south pole of the magnet. At the present time, the north geographic pole corresponds to the south pole of the equivalent bar magnet. This has not always 
been the case. Many times in the history of Earth the direction of the equivalent magnet has pointed in the opposite direction (see below Reversals of the main field).,
 A daily and half-daily index of geomagnetic activity determined from the k indices scaled at two nearly antipodal stations at invariant magnetic latitude 50 degrees (Hartland, England, and Canberra, Australia).

spot groups form as earlier ones decay.,

 A geomagnetic index of the auroral electrojet, which characterizes the maximum range of excursion (both positive and negative) from quiet levels; measured at a given universal time by using the combined 
data from a worldwide ring of high-latitude magnetic observatories. AU (A upper) refers to the greatest positive deviation from the quiet time reference and AL (A lower) to the most negative. By definition 
AE = AU - AL. AO refers to the mean of AU and AL: AO = 1/2 (AU + AL). The AE and companion indexes are provided by the Data Analysis Center for Geomagnetism and Space Magnetism of Kyoto University, Kyoto, 
Japan.,
 A 3-hourly ”equivalent amplitude” index of geomagnetic activity for a specific station or network of stations (represented generically here by k) expressing the range of disturbance in the horizontal 
magnetic field. ”ak” is scaled from the 3-hourly K index according to the following table:K0123456789ak03715274880140240400At NOAA these values are used directly for operational purposes. But to convert 
the ak values to nanoteslas (nT), a local (station-dependent) conversion factor must be found by dividing the station’s lower limit for K=9 by 250. For example, at Boulder and Fredericksburg the lower 
limit for K=9 is 500 nT so the factor is 2; therefore the ak values for these stations are in units of 2 nT. (To obtain an equivalent amplitude in nanotesla for Boulder or Fredericksburg, the index value 
must be doubled.),

 Formally determined from the eight daily ap indices. However, for daily operational uses, NOAA/SWPC estimates the value of the Ap index by measuring the geomagnetic field in near-real time at several 
magnetometer stations around the world. The real-time station indices are used to estimate the official Kp and Ap based on historical data. The value of this estimated Ap index is reported in NOAA daily 
and weekly summaries of geophysical activity.,

in an active region.,
 A faint visual phenomenon associated with geomagnetic activity that is visible mainly in the high-latitude night sky. Aurorae occur within a band of latitudes known as the auroral oval, the location of 
which is dependent on geomagnetic activity. Aurorae are a result of collisions between atmospheric gases and precipitating charged particles (mostly electrons) guided by the geomagnetic field from the 
magnetotail. Each gas (oxygen, nitrogen molecules, and atoms) emits a particular color depending on the energy of the precipitating particles, and atmospheric composition varies with altitude. Since the 
faster precipitating particles penetrate deeper, certain auroral colors, originate preferentially from certain heights in the sky. The auroral altitude range is 80 to 1000 km, but typical aurorae are 100 
to 250 km above the ground; the color of the typical aurora is yellow-green, from a specific transition of atomic oxygen. Auroral light from lower levels in the atmosphere is dominated by blue and red 
bands from molecular nitrogen and oxygen. Above 250 km, auroral light is characterized by a red spectral line of atomic oxygen.  Aurorae in the Northern Hemisphere are called the aurora borealis or ”northern 
lights.” Aurorae in the Southern Hemisphere are called aurora australis. The patterns and forms of the aurora include quiescent arcs, rapidly moving rays, curtains, patches, and veils.,

referred to as Z or Zulu Time.,

 A measure of variation in the geomagnetic field due to the equatorial ring current. It is computed from the H-components at approximately four near-equatorial stations at hourly intervals. At a given 
time, the Dst index is the average of variation over all longitudes.  The reference level is set so that Dst is statistically zero on internationally designated quiet days. An index of -50 or deeper indicates 
a storm-level disturbance, and an index of -200 or deeper is associated with middle latitude aurorae. Dst is determined by the World Data Center C2 for Geomagnetism, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.,

 The components of the geomagnetic field at the surface of the Earth. These elements are usually denoted thus in the literature:X-the geographic northward componentY -the geographic eastward componentZ-the 
vertical component, reckoned positive downwardH-the horizontal intensity, of magnitude (X2 + y2 )1/2F-the total intensity (H2 + Z2 )1/2I-the inclination (or dip) angle, tan -1 (Z/H)D-the declination angle, 
measured from the geographic north direction to the H component direction, positive in an eastward direction.D = tan-l (Y/X)However, in NOAA use, the geomagnetic northward and geomagnetic eastward components 
are called the H and D components. The H axis direction is defined by the mean direction of the horizontal component relative to the geomagnetic north by using the small-angle approximation. Thus the D 
component = H (the horizontal intensity) multiplied by delta D (the declination angle relative to geomagnetic north, expressed in radians).,
 X-the geographic northward componentY -the geographic eastward componentZ-the vertical component, reckoned positive downwardH-the horizontal intensity, of magnitude (X2 + y2 )1/2F-the total intensity 
(H2 + Z2 )1/2I-the inclination (or dip) angle, tan -1 (Z/H)D-the declination angle, measured from the geographic north direction to the H component direction, positive in an eastward direction.D = tan-l 
(Y/X),
 The magnetic field in and around the Earth. The intensity of the magnetic field at the Earth’s surface is approximately 32,000 nT at the equator and 62,000 nT at the north pole (the place where a compass 
needle points vertically downward). The geomagnetic field is dynamic and undergoes continual slow secular changes as well as short-term disturbances (see geomagnetic activity). The geomagnetic field can 
be approximated by a centered dipole field, with the axis of the dipole inclined to the Earth’s rotational axis by about 11.5 degrees. Geomagnetic dipole north is near geographic coordinate 79 degrees 
N and 71 degrees W (near Thule, Greenland), and dipole south is near 79 degrees S and 110 degrees E (near Vostok, Antarctica). The observed or dip poles, where the magnetic field is vertical to the Earth’s 
surface, are near 77 degrees N and 102 degrees W, and 65 degrees S and 139 degrees E. The adopted origin of geomagnetic longitude is the meridian passing through the geomagnetic poles (dipole model) and 
the geographic south pole. (See also corrected geomagnetic coordinates.),

 Term applied to any equatorial satellite with an orbital velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the Earth. The geosynchronous altitude is near 6.6 Earth radii (approximately 36,000 km above the 
Earth’s surface). To be geostationary as well, the satellite must satisfy the additional restriction that its orbital inclination be exactly zero degrees. The net effect is that a geostationary satellite 
is virtually motionless with respect to an observer on the ground.,

each solar cycle. When they occur, GLEs begin a few minutes after flare maximum and last for a few tens of minutes to hours. Intense particle fluxes at lower energies can be expected to follow this initial 
burst of relativistic particles. GLEs are detected by neutron monitors, e.g., the monitor at Thule, Greenland.,
 A faint ring of enhanced emission seen around most or all of the edge of the occulting disk of a coronagraph.  Indicative of a spatially large CME on the front side (Earthward) or back side of the Sun.

 The locus of points on the solar surface where the radial magnetic field vanishes. Inversion lines separate regions of opposing polarity and are often superposed by thin, dark filaments. Inside active

can be used to infer the positions of inversion lines.,

 With reference to x-ray events, those events that are not impulsive in appearance. The exact time threshold separating impulsive from long-duration events is not well defined, but operationally, any event 
requiring 30 minutes or more to decay to one-half peak flux is regarded as an LDE. It has been shown that the likelihood of a coronal mass ejection increases with the duration of an x-ray event, and becomes 
virtually certain for durations of 6 hours or more.,
 A system of prominences in the form of loops associated with major flares, bridging the magnetic inversion line. The lifetime of an LPS is a few hours. Loop prominences observed in H-alpha are distinctly

 On the Sun, an extended H-alpha emission feature of an active region that is seen from the time of emergence of the first magnetic flux until the widely scattered remnant magnetic fields merge with the 
background.  Magnetic fields are more intense in plage, and temperatures are higher than in surrounding, quiescent regions.,
 In the magnetosphere, the core of the magnetotail in which the plasma is hotter and denser than in the tail lobes north and south of it. The plasmasheet is thought to be separated from the tail lobes 
by the sheet of the ”last closed field lines” and it typically lies beyond geosynchronous orbit.,

 An anomalous condition of the polar ionosphere where HF and VHF (3-300 MHz) radiowaves are absorbed, and LF and VLF (3-300 kHz) radiowaves are reflected at lower altitudes than normal. PCAs generally 
originate with major solar flares, beginning within a few hours of the event and maximizing within a day or two of onset. As measured by a riometer, the PCA event threshold is 2 dB of absorption at 30MIlz 
for daytime and 0.5 dB at night. In practice, the absorption is inferred from the proton flux at energies greater than 10 MeV, so that PCAs and proton events are simultaneous. However, the transpolar radio

 Regions of the magnetosphere roughly 1.2 to 6 Earth radii above the equator in which charged particles are stably trapped by closed geomagnetic field lines. There are two belts. The inner belt is part 
of the plasmasphere and corotates with the Earth; its maximum proton density lies near 5000 km. Inner belt protons are mostly high energy (10-50 MeV range) and originate from the decay of secondary neutrons 
created during collisions between cosmic rays and upper atmospheric particles. The outer belt extends on to the magnetopause on the sunward side.  The altitude of maximum proton density is near 16,000-20,000 
km. Outer belt protons are lower energy (about 200 eV to 1 MeV) and come from the solar wind. The outer belt is also characterized by highly variable fluxes of energetic electrons. The radiation belts 
are often called the ”Van Allen radiation belts” because they were discovered in 1968 by a research group at the University of Iowa led by Professor J. A. Van Allen.,
 Emission of the Sun in radio wavelengths from centimeters to dekameters, under both quiet and disturbed conditions. Some patterns, known variously as noise storms, bursts, and sweeps, are identified as 
described below. These types of emission are subjectively rated on an importance scale of 1 to 3, 3 representing the most intense.Type I.   A noise storm composed of many short, narrow-band bursts in the 
meter wavelength range (300-50 MHz), of extremely variable intensity. The storm may last from several hours to several days.Type ll.   Narrow-band emission that begins in the meter range (300 MHz) and 
sweeps slowly (tens of minutes) toward dekameter wavelengths (10 MHz). Type II emissions occur in loose association with major flares and are indicative of a shock wave moving through the solar atmosphere.Type 
III. Narrow-band bursts that sweep rapidly (seconds) from decimeter to dekameter wavelengths (500-0.5 MHz). They often occur in groups and are an occasional feature of complex solar active regions.Type 
IV. A smooth continuum of broad-band bursts primarily in the meter range (300-30 MHz). These bursts occur with some major flare events; they begin 10 to 20 minutes after flare maximum and can last for 
hours.Type V. Short-duration (a few minutes) continuum noise in the dekameter range usually associated with Type III bursts.,
 A fluted or ripple-like instability that can develop on a fluid or plasma boundary surface and propagate along it. This instability is often invoked to explain phenomena in the ionosphere and magnetosphere.,

 A process by which differently directed field lines link up, allowing topological changes of the magnetic field to occur, determining patterns of plasma flow, and resulting in conversion of magnetic energy 
to kinetic and thermal energy of the plasma. Reconnection is invoked to explain the energization and acceleration of the plasmas that are observed in solar flares, magnetic substorms, and elsewhere in 
the solar system.,

the Sun).,

reports confirm the presence of smaller spots; (3) the region produces a solar flare; (4) the region is clearly evident in H-alpha and exceeds 5 heliographic degrees in either latitude or longitude. (See 
also active region.),

hours).,
 In the magnetosphere, a region of current that flows from east to west in a disk-shaped region near the geomagnetic equator in the outer of the Van Allen radiation belts. The current is produced by the 
gradient and curvature drift of the trapped charged particles. The ring current is greatly augmented during magnetic storms because of the hot plasma injected from the magnetotail. This increase in the 
ring current causes a worldwide depression of the horizontal geomagnetic field during a magnetic storm.,
 A specially designed ground-level radio receiver for continuous monitoring of cosmic noise. The absorption of cosmic noise in the polar regions is very sensitive to the solar low-energy cosmic ray flux. 
Absorption events are known as PCAs (polar cap absorption) and are primarily associated with major solar flares.,
 A type of sunspot penumbra characterized by granular (rather than filamentary) structure, brighter intensity than the umbra, and narrow extent, and possibly only partially surrounding the umbra. Penumbrae 
are typically rudimentary during the sunspot formative and decay phases.,
 The usually undesirable response of spacecraft systems to variations in the space environment. High energy particles cause detector noise and/or physical damage to solar cells, electronics, and memory 
devices (single event upsets or ”bitflips”). Large and varying low-to-medium energy particle fluxes can result in a charge buildup between spacecraft components especially during the eclipse season and 
during spacecraft maneuvers.  Atmospheric drag on spacecraft below approximately 1,000 km can increase during geomagnetic storms, resulting in cross-track and in-track orbit errors and orientation problems. 
Various communication interference problems result during solar radio bursts from flares when the Sun is within the field of view of the ground tracking dish. Ionospheric irregularities during geomagnetic 
storms can cause radio telemetry scintillation and fading.,
 Describing a degraded condition of radio propagation characterized by a rapid variation in amplitude and/or phase of a radio signal (usually on a satellite communication link) caused by abrupt variations 
in electron density anywhere along the signal path. It is positively correlated with spread F and to a lesser degree, sporadic E.  Scintillation effects are the most severe at low latitudes, but can also 
be a problem at high latitudes, especially in the auroral oval and over the polar caps.,
 In the solar wind, the area of demarcation between sectors. which are large-scale features distinguished by the predominant direction of the interplanetary magnetic field, toward the Sun (a negative sector), 
or away from the Sun (a positive sector). The sector boundary separating fields of opposite polarity is normally narrow, passing the Earth within minutes to hours as opposed to the week or so needed for 
passage of a typical sector. The solar wind velocities in the boundary region are typically among the lowest observed.,

disturbances (SIDs).,
 With reference to the effects of energetic particles on spacecraft microcircuits - an unexpected change in the logic state of a single digital bit.  SEUs can be either ”soft” (the microcircuit is not 
damaged and can be rewritten to either state), or a latch up, which cannot easily be reset.,
 Transient perturbations of the solar atmosphere as measured by enhanced x-ray emission (see x-ray flare class), typically associated with flares. Five standard terms are used to describe the activity 
observed or expected:Very Low = activity less than C-classLow = C-class activity reachedModerate = M-class activity reached with one to four total M-class events at less than M5 levelHigh = M-class activity 
reached with five or more M-class events at less than M5 -or- one to four M-class events at > M5 levelVery High = five or more flares at > M5 level,
 Very Low = activity less than C-classLow = C-class activity reachedModerate = M-class activity reached with one to four total M-class events at less than M5 levelHigh = M-class activity reached with five 
or more M-class events at less than M5 -or- one to four M-class events at > M5 levelVery High = five or more flares at > M5 level,
 The total radiant energy received vertically from the Sun, per unit area per unit of time, at a position just outside the Earth’s atmosphere when the Earth is at its average distance from the Sun. Radiation 
at all wavelengths from all parts of the solar disk is included. Its value is approximately 2.00 cal cm-2 min-1 = 1.37 kW m-2 and varies slightly (by approximately 0.1 %) from day to day primarily in response 
to the apparent size of sunspots blocking emission from the photosphere.,
 Specifications for a location on the solar surface.  The location of a specific feature on the Sun (for example, a sunspot) is complicated by the fact that there is a tilt of 7.25 degrees between the 
ecliptic plane and the solar equatorial plane as well as a true wobble of the solar rotational axis. (Only twice a year are the solar north pole and the celestial north pole aligned.)  Consequently, to 
specify a location on the solar surface, three coordinates (P, B, L) are necessary to define a grid. Daily values for the coordinates in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) are listed in The Astronomical 
Almanac published annually by the U.S. Naval Observatory. The terms used to refer to the coordinates are defined as follows:P-angle:  The position angle between the geocentric north pole and the solar 
rotational north pole measured eastward from geocentric north. The range in P is plus or minus 26.31°.Bo:   Heliographic latitude of the central point of the solar disk; also called the B-angle. The range 
of B is plus or minus 7.23°, correcting for the tilt of the ecliptic with respect to the solar equatorial plane.Example:  If (P, B) = (-26.21°, -6.54°), the heliographic latitude of the central point on 
the solar disk is -6.54° (the north rotational pole is not visible), and the angle between the projection onto the disk of the geocentric north pole and the solar north rotational pole is 26.21° to the 
west. L:   Heliographic longitude of the central point of the solar disk. The longitude value is determined with reference to a system of fixed longitudes rotating on the Sun at a rate of 13.2 degrees/day 
(the mean rate of rotation observed from central meridian transits of sunspots). The standard meridian on the Sun is defined to be the meridian that passed through the ascending node of the Sun’s equator 
on 1 January 1854 at 1200 UTC and is calculated for the present day by assuming a uniform sidereal period of rotation of 25.38 days.  Once P, B, and L are known, the latitude, central meridian distance, 
and longitude of a specific solar feature can be determined as follows:Latitude.  The angular distance from the solar equator, measured north or south along the meridian.Central meridian distance (CMD). 
 The angular distance in solar longitude measured from the central meridian. This position is relative to the view from Earth and will change as the Sun rotates. Therefore, this coordinate should not be 
confused with heliographic positions that are fixed with respect to the solar surface.Longitude.  The angular distance from a standard meridian (0 degrees heliographic longitude), measured from east to 
west (0 to 360 degrees) along the Sun’s equator. It is computed by combining CMD with the longitude of the central meridian at the time of the observation, interpolating between ephemeris values (for 0000 
UT) by using the synodic rate of solar rotation (27.2753 days, 13.2 degrees/day).,
 (1) synodic: 13.39 degrees -2.7 degrees sin2 J per day (J = solar latitude). (2) sidereal: 14.38 degrees -2. 7 degrees sin2 J per day. The difference between sidereal and synodic rates is the Earth orbital 
motion of 0.985 degrees/day.,

 A region of the Earth centered near 25S and 50W (near the Atlantic coast of Brazil) of low geomagnetic field intensity owing to the fact that the geomagnetic field axis is offset from the center of the 
Earth.  One consequence of the SAA is that trapped particles in the plasmasphere drift closer to the Earth’s surface and can more easily be lost into the atmosphere. The result is that the F region (see 
ionosphere) is highly variable in this region, and satellites in low Earth orbits suffer greater radiation doses when they pass through the SAA. There is a corresponding location of maximum geomagnetic 
field intensity in Southeast Asia.,
 A term that encompasses all the charging effects on a spacecraft due to the environment in space. Occasionally this term is used in a more limited sense to mean surface charging.,
 Rapidly changing, predominantly vertical, spike-like structures in the solar chromosphere observed above the limb. Spicules appear to be ejected from the low chromosphere at velocities of 20 to 30 km/s, 
reaching a height of about 9000 km and then falling back or fading. The total lifetime is 5 to 10 minutes.,
 Transient, localized patches of relatively high electron density in the E region of the ionosphere, which significantly affect radiowave propagation. Sporadic E can occur during daytime or nighttime, 
and varies markedly with latitude. Es can be associated with thunderstorms, meteor showers, solar, and geomagnetic activity.,
 Luminous material ejected from a solar flare with sufficient velocity to escape the Sun (675 km/s). Sprays are usually seen in H-alpha with complex and rapidly changing form. There is little evidence

 A condition of the F region of the ionosphere caused by patches of ionization that scatter or duct radio signals, characterized on ionograms by a wide range of heights of reflected pulses. In equatorial 
latitudes spread F is most commonly observed at night and may be negatively correlated with geomagnetic activity.  At high latitudes spread F occurs throughout the daytime and is positively correlated 
with magnetic activity. The latitude of minimum occurrence of spread F is near 30 degrees magnetic latitude.,

to about 50 km.,
 A code word designating a major disturbance of the winter, polar, middle atmosphere from the tropopause to the ionosphere, lasting for several days at a time and characterized by a warming of the stratospheric 
temperature by some tens of degrees. There is no evidence that stratwarms are caused by solar events, or that they affect the lower atmosphere.  The primary effect is upon HF propagation.,
 A geomagnetic perturbation lasting 1 to 2 hours, which tends to occur during local post-midnight nighttime. The magnitude of the substorm is largest in the auroral zone, potentially reaching several thousand 
nanotesla. A substorm corresponds to an injection of charged particles from the magnetotail into the auroral oval.,

noise absorptions, and signal enhancements.,
 An area seen as a dark spot, in contrast with its surroundings, on the photosphere of the Sun. Sunspots are concentrations of magnetic flux, typically occurring in bipolar clusters or groups. They appear 
dark because they are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. Larger and darker sunspots sometimes are surrounded (completely or partially) by penumbrae. The dark centers are umbrae. The smallest, immature 
spots are sometimes called pores.,
 As devised by McIntosh, a 3-letter designation of the white-light characteristics of a sunspot group. The general form of the designation is Zpc. One letter is chosen from each of the following three 
categories.Z (the modified Zurich class of the group): A-A small single sunspot or very small group of spots with the same magnetic polarity, without penumbra. B-Bipolar sunspot group with no penumbra. 
C-An elongated bipolar sunspot group. One sunspot must have penumbra, and penumbra does not exceed 5 ° in longitudinal extent. D-An elongated bipolar sunspot group with penumbra on both ends of the group; 
longitudinal extent of penumbra is more than 5°, but does not exceed 10°. E-An elongated bipolar sunspot group with penumbra on both ends. Longitudinal extent of penumbra exceeds 10° but not 15°. F-An 
elongated bipolar sunspot group with penumbra on both ends. Longitudinal extent of penumbra exceeds 15°. H-A unipolar sunspot group with penumbra. Class H sunspot groups become compact Class D or larger

and adjusted for all other observatories to obtain approximately the same R number). The standard number, RI, once derived at Zurich (see Wolf number), is now being derived at Brussels and is denoted by 
RI. Often, the term ”sunspot number” is used in reference to the widely distributed smoothed sunspot number.,
 A system of large-scale velocity cells that does not vary significantly over the quiet solar surface or with phase of the solar cycle. The cells are presumably convective in origin with weak upward motions 
in the center, downward motions at the borders, and horizontal motions of typically 0.3 to 0.4 km/s. Magnetic flux is more intense along the borders of the cells.,
 A jet of material from active regions that reaches coronal heights and then either fades or returns into the chromosphere along the trajectory of ascent. Surges typically last 10 to 20 minutes and tend

field.,
 In early 2016, the Geomagnetism team installed an experimental camera at the Eskdalemuir observatory to see if we could observe the Aurora Borealis during times of heightened geomagnetic activity. The 
aurora are caused by large electrical currents flowing in the ionosphere around 100km above our heads. These current systems are normally found in an oval around the magnetic pole at high latitudes (such 
as over Iceland), but during geomagnetic storms the oval expands southwards and can move to lower latitudes. ,
 When it does, the magnetic field recorded at our observatories starts to vary rapidly - first at the station furthest north in Lerwick (Shetland Islands), then in Eskdalemuir (the Scottish Borders) and, 
if the storm is large enough, in Hartland (Devon).  During these stormy periods, the aurora may become visible - though it's not always guaranteed. In fact, it's an area of on-going research as to why 
some storms produce aurora visible at low latitudes and others do not. The Geomagnetism team issue alerts if we think the aurora may be visible in the next day or two. However, we are not always correct 
as there are large uncertainties about how intense or large a storm may become.,
 We decided to see if we could capture images of the aurora by using a camera automatically triggered from magnetic field variations at an observatory. We've been working with Raspberry Pi computers for 
our School magnetometer project over the past few years so we are familiar with them. As you can now buy a cheap five mega-pixel camera for the Pi, it seemed a good item to experiment with.,
 We then built the system into the waterproof box. It's shown below with an initial fisheye test lens but without the external Ethernet cable plugged in. Tests showed that the lens had large aberration 
on the edges so we bought another lens and mounted it directly onto the PiCam board. (Note you have to remove the small lens that comes with the PiCam first.),
 We chose to write our software in the Python language. This comes with the Raspberry Pi as part of the Raspbian OS. There are also many useful modules that are freely available. ,
 The first problem can be solved by querying a magnetic real-time index such as the Kp or Dst index. These are available from the NOAA SWPC or Kyoto University. The Kp is updated every 15 minutes or so 
and is actually a global index rather than indicating local activity. The Dst index is an hourly index and again reflects global activity. ,
 Instead we chose to use a BGS produced index called the hourly standard deviation index (HSD). This is a local activity measure which is updated every five minutes. Code was written to download these 
data every five minutes using the urllib2 modules in Python. The value at the end of the file was checked. Thresholds of 35 nT for Lerwick and 20 nT for Eskdalemuir were set to trigger the camera. If either 
is reached the camera is triggered, as on a clear night, the aurora may be visible on the horizon toward Lerwick though it may not have reached the Scottish Borders yet. ,
 The next task is to work out if it is dark. For this, the pyEphem package was installed. For a given latitude and longitude and time, the pyEphem package works out what the local sunset and sunrise times 
are. ,
 Finally, we chose the picamera module to drive the camera. From research on the web and testing in a dark location (i.e. the office at night-time) , it was found that setting the shutter speed to 6 seconds 
with an ISO of 800 should be suitable for capturing images of the stars and hopefully aurora. ,
 So, in summary, the code runs a check every five minutes. It initially downloads the latest HSD file and tests if HSD has become larger than the threshold. If so, the code checks if it is dark and then 
the camera is triggered. A timestamp is placed onto the image and a note is made into a log file. The camera continues to take images every five minutes until the geomagnetic activity declines or the sun 
rises.,
 Eskdalemuir observatory was originally built in 1904. As it's very rural, it's very dark at night but has limited bandwidth for transmitting data, given all the other instrumental demands on it. Hence 
we have to limit the size of the images and frequency with which we can transfer them out of the Pi. Eskdalemuir is also a rather wet and cloudy place, so even if there is strong magnetic activity, we 
may not capture any decent images.,
 The camera was installed in June 2016. The first task was to check it all worked with the BGS network in Eskdalemuir. It was set up in the Superintendent's office and all worked well (image below). ,

 The next task was to lay the PoE cable from the network switch in the office to the roof. This involved passing a cable through two floors, a window and up to the balcony where we wanted to mount the 
camera. Once the wire was laid, the camera was mounted on some unused scaffolding and the dome was placed on top.,
 The camera has been triggered by a few periods of higher activity but it's been raining or cloudy most evenings. The images below show two of the better images captured. This first image was taken on 
the 20th July 2016 - you can see clouds and some stars. The image has been processed to increase the gain and the colours have been auto-corrected using IRFANview. The second image was taken on 28th September 
2016. This image has been processed to increase the gain and the colours have been auto-corrected so the green colour of the aurora is visible.,
 Once we have proven that the camera can capture images, we may be able add them to our alert pages the following day once they have been processed. It will also be interesting to see if this relatively 
cheap and cheerful setup will survive the winter months.,
 It is easier to see the northern lights (aurora borealis) in the UK than you might think. All you need is a dark place, a clear sky and very good timing! ,
 The good timing is important as the northern lights are a result of a geomagnetic storm. These storms are short-lived  periods of high geomagnetic activity where the Earth's  magnetic field  changes very 
quickly and strong electric currents flow high in the  atmosphere.,
             The aurora is a consequence of activity on  the surface of the Sun. Occasionally  there are large  explosions on the Sun, and huge amounts of charged particles are thrown out into space. These 
particles sometimes travel towards Earth where they are captured by the Earth's magnetic field and guided towards the geomagnetic polar regions.,
 On their way down these particles are slowed down by Earth's atmosphere, which acts as a shield. These charged particles collide with gas molecules in the atmosphere. The energy released in these collisions 
is given off as light. ,
             When a charged particle collides with a molecule in the atmosphere the molecule becomes excited. The excited molecule is unstable and will give up its extra energy by emitting light. ,
 The colour of the light depends on the molecules being excited. Like a sodium street light which gives off an orange light, the oxygen, nitrogen and other gases in the atmosphere have their own particular 
colours resulting  in the range of blues, greens, yellows and reds observed in the aurora.,
             The auroral ovals represent the places on Earth where aurora occur most often and with greatest intensity. Under normal conditions the northern oval covers Scandinavia, Greenland, Alaska, 
 Canada and  Russia. The southern oval covers the Antarctic regions. With increasing geomagnetic activity the ovals widen and spread, so  that during periods of high geomagnetic activity it becomes possible 
to see aurora further south in the UK.          ,
 Geomagnetic storms follow the 11-year solar cycle. The chance of big magnetic storms will be greatest around the years leading up to solar maximum and shortly afterwards. The current progress of the solar 
cycle  is tracked by counting the number of sunspots seen on the Sun.,
  There are many ways to represent geomagnetic activity. One of these is the Kp index which  ranks the variations in geomagnetic activity from 0 to 9, in 3-hour intervals. The larger the Kp index is, the 
stronger the storm and the further south the northern lights will be visible. The map on the right shows roughly where you might expect to see aurora based on Kp index levels.,
 Declination, or compass direction, (D) is the lower trace on each image and the horizontal             force (H) is the upper trace. Universal Time is the time recorded here (astronomical) plus       
      12 hours and measured D precedes H by approximately 12 hours. ,
 For reference the marked 'solar             flare effect�, beginning at 23:15 recorded time on August 31st, is at 11:15 Universal Time             on September 1st. It has been measured as 110 nT in H 
and 0.283 degrees in D. ,
 Please note that these timings are approximate and should not             be regarded as definitive. Also note, the size and scale of each image             is only approximately similar, day-to-day. 
Some data have also been lost,             either due to ink and paper degradation, or because the variations were             so large they were off-scale. ,
 This is one example of the historical data contained in the British Geological             Survey geomagnetic archives. We have digistised our complete collection of over 250,000 magnetograms which are 
now available to view online.,
  Swarm satellite orbital separation over the mission. After launch, Swarm A and Swarm B will be lowered to a height of 450 km while Swarm C will rise to 530 km. After two years their orbital planes will 
be approximately perpendicular. Copyright: ESA.(click to enlarge)              ,
 The European Space Agency (ESA)  launched a new satellite mission called Swarm on 22nd November 2013. The mission consists of three identical satellites which will measure the strength and direction of 
Earth's magnetic field to new levels of precision. The new data will be processed by BGS to produce the most accurate maps of the Earth's magnetic field ever.,
  The magnetic field we measure comes from four main sources - the main field from the Earth's core, the field from the Earth's crust (magnetic rocks), the upper atmosphere (ionosphere) and the interaction 
of the Earth and the Sun's magnetic fields (magnetosphere). ,
 In order to best measure the field, the satellites will orbit in a unique configuration. Two satellites will fly side-by-side at height of 450 km, while the third satellite will fly at an altitude of 
530 km. The lower two satellites will allow very fine measurements of the magnetic field generated by the rocks in the Earth's crust, which are difficult to detect otherwise. The upper satellite will give 
a simultaneous measurement at a different location. This is important for identifying magnetic fields generated by the magnetosphere and ionosphere.  ,
 The combination of all three satellites will provide better maps and models of the main field which are primarily used for navigation purposes (e.g. for shipping, in smart phone map applications, or directional 
drilling for oil and gas). The measurements will help us better understand the impact of space weather events on technology such as satellite communications and GPS accuracy. ,
 Each satellite is nine metres long, which a main body covered in solar panels and a four metre boom on which the sensitive magnetic field measuring instruments sit - away from electrical and magnetic 
interference. The magnetic field is measured by two instruments - (1) by the scalar instrument at the end of the boom which measures the strength of the field and (2) the vector instrument in the middle 
of the boom, which measures the direction of the field, using star cameras for accurate orientation of the satellite. ,
 The satellites also measures the electric field in the ionosphere using novel Langmuir probes and an electric field instrument sited on the front of the satellite, giving a full physical measurement of 
the field in the upper atmosphere for the first time. ,
 All three satellites are polar-orbiting allowing them to survey almost the entire planet (except for a small polar gap). The satellites are all launched together on the same rocket to about 500 km height. 
Soon after launch, the lower two satellites (named Swarm A and Swarm B) will drop to 450 km altitude while the third (Swarm C) will be raised to 530 km. The effect is to cause the orbital planes of the 
satellites to precess around the Earth at different rates. After two years, the orbital planes of the upper and lower satellites will be approximately perpendicular to each other. This allows the entire 
Earth to be sampled more quickly and to identify the sources of the magnetic fields better. ,
 The data will be provided for free by ESA on their website. In addition, ESA have commissioned BGS and five other European research institutes to produce specific types of magnetic field maps, models 
and processed data for the general public. In the UK, several universities and research institutes will be involved in the scientific research over the mission lifetime. The BGS Geomagnetism team have 
spent the past three years preparing for the launch of Swarm.           ,
 If you wish to see the northern lights (aurora borealis) in the UK you need to be on the look-out for disturbed geomagnetic activity (magnetic storms). This can be due to space weather effects from the 
Sun. See Viewing Northern lights in the UK for more info.,
 If there has been an alert issued and we expect something to arrive in the next day or two you need to keep an eye on the geomagnetic activity levels and look out for disturbed or storm conditions.,
 In the UK BGS run three magnetic observatories that constantly monitor the changes in the Earth's magnetic field. We have observatories in Lerwick  in Shetland, Eskdalemuir in Dumfries and Galloway and 
Hartland in Devon.,
 One way of describing the activity levels is by a magnetic scale called the K-index. This is a 3-hour index with levels between 0-9. The chart below right shows the values for the three UK observatories. 
It shows the K values, the level of activity and the equivalent NOAA G-scale levels. Also plotted is the global Kp scale showing overall activity across the globe.          ,
 The most common understanding of magnetic poles is that they are the positions on               the Earth's surface where the geomagnetic field is vertical. These               poles are called dip poles, 
and the north and south dip poles               do not have to be (and are not now) antipodal. In principle the               dip poles can be found by experiment, conducting a magnetic survey         
      to determine where the field is vertical.,
 Another definition comes from global models of the geomagnetic                 field. Models of this type, such as the International Geomagnetic               Reference Field (IGRF) include an equivalent 
(but fictional) magnetic               dipole at the centre of the Earth in their representation of the               field. This dipole defines an axis that intersects the Earth's surface             
  at two antipodal points. These points are called geomagnetic               poles. The axis of the equivalent dipole is currently inclined               at about 10° to the Earth's rotation axis. The 
IGRF can also               be used to compute dip pole positions. These model dip poles               do not agree with the measured dip pole positions. The geomagnetic               poles and model dip 
poles cannot be located by direct local measurement.,
 In practice, there are many difficulties in the experimental               determination of the locations of the dip poles, not least the remoteness               and harsh climatic conditions. The main 
difficulty arises from the               rapidly varying magnetic fields which originate in a region of near-Earth               space called the magnetosphere. This region is defined by the pressure  
             of the continuous stream of charged particles from the Sun, the               so-called solar wind, on the Earth's magnetic field. Many dynamic               electrical current systems exist 
on the surface of, and inside the               magnetosphere and are connected to the ionised upper atmosphere               at high latitudes. As a result, the dip poles move considerable            
   distances over one day, tracing out approximately oval-shaped loci               on a daily basis, with large variation from one day to the next               depending on solar activity. ,
 Another complicating factor is the presence of magnetic               material in the underlying rocks, i.e. the crustal magnetic field.               This is not included in models such as the IGRF but 
may be another               reason for differences between the model dip poles and measured               dip poles.,
 Scientists, map makers and polar explorers have an               interest in the locations of the dip and geomagnetic poles. Although               one cannot make any observations in the region of the 
geomagnetic               poles that might indicate their positions, these poles are arguably               of greater significance than the dip poles. This is because the               auroral ovals, 
which are approximately 5° latitude bands where               the spectacular aurora are likely to be seen, are centred on the               geomagnetic poles. They are usually displaced slightly to the 
night-side               of the geomagnetic poles and are very variable in size: bands of               greatest activity occur between 15 and 25° from the geomagnetic               poles. In relation 
to this, many coordinate systems used in studies               of the Earth's magnetosphere have the dipole axis as one of their               defining axes. In addition, magnetic field               reversals 
are defined by the flipping of the geomagnetic poles.               These ancient poles are defined by the direction of the ancient               magnetic field frozen into certain kinds of rock, and in 
their derivation,               make the assumption that the field is simply that of a tilted dipole               located at the Earth's centre.,
 The Earth has a magnetic field, as can be seen by using a magnetic compass. It is mainly generated in the very hot molten core of the planet and has probably existed throughout most of the Earth's lifetime. 
The magnetic field is largely that of a dipole, by which we mean that it has one North pole and one South pole. At these places, a compass needle will point straight down, or up, respectively. It is often 
described as being similar in nature to the field of a bar (e.g. fridge) magnet. However there is much small-scale variation in the Earth's field, which is quite different from that of a bar magnet. In 
any event, we can say that there are currently two poles observed on the surface of the Earth, one in the Northern hemisphere and one in the Southern hemisphere. ,
 By magnetic reversal, or 'flip', we mean the process by which the North pole is transformed into a South pole and the South pole becomes a North pole. Interestingly, the magnetic field may sometimes only 
undergo an 'excursion', rather than a reversal. Here, it suffers a large decrease in its overall strength, that is, the force that moves the compass needle. During an excursion the field does not reverse, 
but later regenerates itself with the same polarity, that is, North remains North and South remains South. ,
 Measurements have been made of the Earth's magnetic field more or less continuously since about 1840. Some measurements even go back to the 1500s, for example at Greenwich in London. If we look at the 
trend in the strength of the magnetic field over this time (for example the so-called 'dipole moment' shown in the graph below) we can see a downward trend. Indeed projecting this forward in time would 
suggest zero dipole moment in about 1500-1600 years time. This is one reason why some people believe the field may be in the early stages of a reversal. We also know from studies of the magnetisation of 
minerals in ancient clay pots that the Earth's magnetic field was approximately twice as strong in Roman times as it is now. ,
 Even so, the current strength of the magnetic  field is not particularly low in terms of the range of values it has had over  the last 50,000 years and it is nearly 800,000 years since the last reversal. 
Also, bearing in mind what we said about 'excursions' above, and knowing what we do about the properties of mathematical models of the magnetic field, it is far from clear we can easily extrapolate to 
1500 years hence. ,
 We have no complete record of the history of any reversal, so any claims we can make are mostly on the basis of mathematical models of the field behaviour and partly on limited evidence from rocks that 
retain an imprint of the ancient magnetic field present when they were formed. For example, the mathematical simulations seem to suggest that a full reversal may take about one to several thousand years 
to complete. This is fast by geological standards but slow on a human time scale. ,
 As above, we have limited evidence from geological measurements about the patterns of change in the magnetic field during a reversal. We might expect to see, based on models of the field run on supercomputers, 
a far more complicated field pattern at the Earth's surface, with perhaps more than one North and South pole at any given time. We might also see the poles 'wandering' with time from their current positions 
towards and across the equator. The overall strength of the field, anywhere on the Earth, may be no more than a tenth of its strength now.,
 Almost certainly not. The Earth's magnetic field is contained within a region of space, known as the magnetosphere, by the action of the solar wind. The magnetosphere deflects many, but not all, of the 
high-energy particles that flow from the Sun in the solar wind and from other sources in the galaxy. Sometimes the Sun is particularly active, for example when there are many sunspots, and it may send 
clouds of high-energy particles in the direction of the Earth. During such solar 'flares' and 'coronal mass ejections', astronauts in Earth orbit may need extra shelter to avoid higher doses of radiation. 
Therefore we know that the Earth's magnetic field offers only some, rather than complete, resistance to particle radiation from space. Indeed high-energy particles can actually be accelerated within the 
magnetosphere.,
 At the Earth's surface, the atmosphere acts as an extra blanket to stop all but the most energetic of the solar and galactic radiation. In the absence of a magnetic field, the atmosphere would still stop 
most of the radiation. Indeed the atmosphere shields us from high-energy radiation as effectively as a concrete layer some 13 feet thick. ,
 Human beings and their ancestors have been on the Earth for a number of million years, during which there have been many reversals, and there is no obvious correlation between human development and reversals. 
Similarly, reversal patterns do not match patterns in species extinction during geological history. ,
 Some animals, such as pigeons and whales, may use the Earth's magnetic field for direction finding. Assuming that a reversal takes a number of thousand years, that is, over many generations of each species, 
each animal may well adapt to the changing magnetic environment, or develop different methods of navigation.,
 The source of the magnetic field is the iron-rich liquid outer core of the Earth. This liquid moves in complex ways as a result of the convection of the heat deep within the core and of the rotation of 
the planet. The motion of the core fluid is continuous and never stops, even during a reversal. It can only stop when the energy source fails. Heat is produced at least partly because of the solidification 
of the liquid core onto the solid inner core that sits at the centre of the Earth. This process has operated continuously over billions of years. At the top of the liquid core, some 3000 km beneath our 
feet and below the rocky mantle, the fluid may travel at horizontal speeds of tens of kilometres per year. The motion of this metal fluid across existing magnetic field lines of force produces electrical 
currents and these, in turn, generate more magnetic field. This is a process known as advection. To balance any growth of the field, and thus stabilise what we call the 'geodynamo', we need diffusion, 
where field 'leaks' away from the core and is destroyed. Ultimately, the core fluid flow produces a complicated magnetic field pattern at the Earth's surface with a complicated time variation. ,
 Simulations of the geodynamo on supercomputers have demonstrated the complex nature of the field and its behaviour over time. Simulations have also revealed reversals in the polarity, where the magnetic 
North pole is replaced by a South pole, and vice versa. In such simulations, the strength of the main dipole appears to weaken, perhaps to about 10% of its normal value (but not vanish) and the existing 
poles may wander across the globe and be joined by other temporary North and South magnetic poles (the 'non-dipole field'). ,
 The solid iron inner core of the Earth has been shown in these simulations to be important in controlling the reversal process. Because it is a solid, the inner core can't generate magnetic field by advection, 
but any field that is generated in the fluid outer core can diffuse, or spread, into the inner core. The field generation process (advection) in the outer core seems to regularly attempt to reverse. But 
unless the field locked into the inner core first diffuses away, a true reversed field cannot become established throughout the core. Essentially the inner core resists any 'new' field diffusing in and 
perhaps only one in every ten such reversal attempts is successful. ,
 It is worth stressing that these results, while fascinating in themselves, are not known to be strictly true of the 'real' Earth. However, we have mathematical models of the Earth's magnetic field for 
the last 400 years, with early models based largely on observations made by mariners engaged in merchant and naval shipping. From these models and extrapolating down into the Earth, it is known that regions 
of reversed flux at the core-mantle boundary have grown over time. In these regions the compass points in the opposite direction, in or out of the core, compared to that of surrounding areas. It is the 
growth in area of such a reversed flux patch under the south Atlantic that is primarily responsible for the decay in the main dipolar field. This reverse patch is also responsible for the minimum in field 
strength called the South Atlantic Anomaly, now centred over south America. In this region energetic particles can approach Earth more closely, causing increased radiation risk to low Earth orbit satellites.,

 There is much work yet to be done in understanding the properties of the deep Earth. This is a world where the crushing forces and core temperatures similar to that of the surface of the Sun take our 
scientific understanding to the limit. ,
 During times of heightened space weather, intense solar flares and associated plasma clouds are expelled from the Sun. Known as coronal mass ejections (CME), these magnetic clouds can sometimes head directly 
towards the Earth hitting the Earth's magnetosphere around 1-3 days later. This will result in a geomagnetic storm. ,
 Charged particles in the magnetosphere then follow the magnetic field to the auroral oval where strong currents, known as electrojets, are created. This happens in the ionosphere, which stretches from 
a height of about 50 km to more than 1000 km above the Earth's surface. ,
 Systems on or near Earth such as GPS and electricity networks are increasingly vulnerable to damage by intense space weather events and human activities are increasingly dependent on such systems. ,
 When the ionospheric currents change over time - as happens rapidly during geomagnetic storms - the associated magnetic variations will induce an electric field in the Earth. This in turn will cause currents 
to flow along any conducting path. These electrical currents are known as geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) which can surge along oil and gas pipelines and high-tension electricity transmission lines, 
via transformer groundings.,
  A major power outage  occurred in Quebec in 1989 where 6 million people lost electrical power around 12 hours. The  blackout was due to the loss of Static Var Compensators (SVC)  and the loss of voltage 
control during a severe  storm. The root cause was due to high level of voltage harmonics which incorrectly tripped seven SVC (more information here).,

 BGS operates magnetic observatories, three of which are located in the UK, where continuous highly accurate measurements of the Earth's magnetic field and it's variations are recorded every second. These 
data are available in real time for use as a proxy for GICs. ,
 Scientific studies have also been carried out by various BGS scientists over the past decade to model GICs in power grids in the UK and investigate the likely risk based on past events.  ,
 BGS also provide forecasts of geomagnetic activity. Each day, a team of forecasters take it in turns to analyse the space weather data available and make predictions of geomagnetic activity levels likely 
on Earth. ,
 Examples of the types of monitoring and forecasting services possible can be viewed here, although new bespoke services can always be developed depending on the requirement. See also our Geomagnetism 
data and services and example of other ground effects of space weather.,
 The phrase \predict and prepare\, a quote from Jane Lubchenco, of NOAA in a recent Guardian article, should certainly be the way forward. Although successful prediction of geomagnetic storms is still 
a very difficult task, space weather forecasters around the world are getting more and more help from the increased quality of the space-based monitoring of the Sun's activity and solar wind transients. 
,
 The equally high quality ground based monitoring systems, such as magnetic observatories, provide real-time information on what is actually happening on the ground and can help optimise preparations. 
Combining this with modelling of the GIC response to geomagnetic activity, whether it be in power systems or pipelines, is critical if companies are to be fully prepared. ,

 Microscopic minerals excavated from an ancient outcrop of Jack Hills, in Western Australia, have been the subject of intense geological study, as they seem to bear traces of the Earth’s magnetic field 
reaching as far back as 4.2 billion years ago. That’s almost 1 billion years earlier than when the magnetic field was previously thought to originate, and nearly back to the time when the planet itself 
was formed.,
 But as intriguing as this origin story may be, an MIT-led team has now found evidence to the contrary. In a paper published today in Science Advances, the team examined the same type of crystals, called 
zircons, excavated from the same outcrop, and have concluded that zircons they collected are unreliable as recorders of ancient magnetic fields.,
 “There is no robust evidence of a magnetic field prior to 3.5 billion years ago, and even if there was a field, it will be very difficult to find evidence for it in Jack Hills zircons,” says Caue Borlina, 
a graduate student in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). “It’s an important result in the sense that we know what not to look for anymore.”,
 Borlina is the paper’s first author, which also includes EAPS Professor Benjamin Weiss, Principal Research Scientist Eduardo Lima, and Research Scientist Jahandar Ramezan of MIT, along with others from 
Cambridge University, Harvard University, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Alabama, and Princeton University.,
 Earth’s magnetic field is thought to play an important role in making the planet habitable. Not only does a magnetic field set the direction of our compass needles, it also acts as a shield of sorts, 
deflecting away solar wind that might otherwise eat away at the atmosphere.,
 Scientists know that today the Earth’s magnetic field is powered by the solidification of the planet’s liquid iron core. The cooling and crystallization of the core stirs up the surrounding liquid iron, 
creating powerful electric currents that generate a magnetic field stretching far out into space. This magnetic field is known as the geodynamo.,
 Multiple lines of evidence have shown that the Earth’s magnetic field existed at least 3.5 billion years ago. However, the planet’s core is thought to have started solidifying just 1 billion years ago, 
meaning that the magnetic field must have been driven by some other mechanism prior to 1 billion years ago. Pinning down exactly when the magnetic field formed could help scientists figure out what generated 
it to begin with.,
 “In the Earth’s first billion years, between 4.4 billion and 3.5 billion years, that’s when life was emerging,” Borlina says. “Whether you have a magnetic field at that time has different implications 
for the environment in which life emerged on Earth. That’s the motivation for our work.”,
 Scientists have traditionally used minerals in ancient rocks to determine the orientation and intensity of Earth’s magnetic field back through time. As rocks form and cool, the electrons within individual 
grains can shift in the direction of the surrounding magnetic field. Once the rock cools past a certain temperature, known as the Curie temperature, the orientations of the electrons are set in stone, 
so to speak. Scientists can determine their age and use standard magnetometers to measure their orientation, to estimate the strength and orientation of the Earth’s magnetic field at a given point in time.,

 Since 2001, Weiss and his group have been studying the magnetization of the Jack Hills rocks and zircon grains, with the challenging goal of establishing whether they contain ancient records of the Earth’s 
magnetic field.  ,
 “The Jack Hills zircons are some of the most weakly magnetic objects studied in the history of paleomagnetism,” Weiss says. “Furthermore, these zircons include the oldest known Earth materials, meaning 
that there are many geological events that could have reset their magnetic records.”,
 In 2015, a separate research group that had also started studying the Jack Hills zircons argued that they found evidence of magnetic material in zircons that they dated to be 4.2 billion years old — the 
first evidence that Earth’s magnetic field may have existed prior to 3.5 billion years ago.,
 But Borlina notes that the team did not confirm whether the magnetic material they detected actually formed during or after the zircon crystal formed 4.2 billion years ago — a goal that he and his team 
took on for their new paper.,
 Borlina, Weiss, and their colleagues had collected rocks from the same Jack Hills outcrop, and from those samples, extracted 3,754 zircon grains, each around 150 micrometers long — about the width of 
a human hair. Using standard dating techniques, they determined the age of each zircon grain, which ranged from 1 billion to 4.2 billion years old.,
 Around 250 crystals were older than 3.5 billion years. The team isolated and imaged those samples, looking for signs of cracks or secondary materials, such as minerals that may have been deposited on 
or within the crystal after it had fully formed, and searched for evidence that they were significantly heated over the last few billion years since they formed. Of these 250, they identified just three 
zircons that were relatively free of such impurities and therefore could contain suitable magnetic records.,
 The team then carried out detailed experiments on these three zircons to determine what kinds of magnetic materials they might contain. They eventually determined that a magnetic mineral called magnetite 
was present in two of the three zircons. Using a high-resolution quantum diamond magnetometer, the team looked at cross-sections of each of the two zircons to map the location of the magnetite in each 
crystal.,
 They discovered magnetite lying along cracks or damaged zones within the zircons. Such cracks, Borlina says, are pathways that allow water and other elements inside the rock. Such cracks could have let 
in secondary magnetite that settled into the crystal much later than when the zircon originally formed. Either way, Borlina says the evidence is clear: These zircons cannot be used as a reliable recorder 
for Earth’s magnetic field.,
 “This is evidence we can’t trust these zircon measurements for the record of the Earth’s magnetic field,” Borlina says. “We’ve shown that, before 3.5 billion years ago, we still have no idea when Earth’s 
magnetic field started.”,
 “For me, these results cast a great deal of doubt on the potential of Jack Hills zircons to faithfully record the palaeomagnetic field intensity prior to 3.5 billion years,” says Andy Biggin, professor 
of paleomagnetism at the University of Liverpool, who was not involved in the research. “That said, this debate has been raging, like the palaeomagnetic equivalent to Brexit, since 2015 and I would be 
very surprised if this were the last word on the matter. It is nigh on impossible to prove a negative and neither methods nor interpretations are ever beyond question.”,
 “The team that reported the original zircon magnetic study deserves a lot of credit for trying to tackle this enormously challenging problem,” Weiss says.  “As a result of all the work from both groups, 
we now understand much better how to study the magnetism of ancient geological materials. We now can begin to apply this knowledge to other mineral grains and to grains from other planetary bodies.”,
 The magnetosphere is the region of space surrounding Earth where the dominant magnetic field is the magnetic field of Earth, rather than the magnetic field of interplanetary space. The magnetosphere is 
formed by the interaction of the solar wind with Earth’s magnetic field. This figure illustrates the shape and size of Earth’s magnetic field that is continually changing as it is buffeted by the solar 
wind. ,
 It has been several thousand years since the Chinese discovered that certain magnetic minerals, called lodestones, would align in roughly the north-south direction. The reason for this effect wasn’t understood, 
though, until 1600, when William Gilbert published De Magnete and demonstrated that our Earth behaved like a giant magnet and loadstones were aligning with Earth’s magnetic field. ,
 After several more centuries of investigation, it is now known that Earth’s magnetic field is quite complex, but still, to a great extent, can be viewed as a dipole, with north and south poles like a 
simple bar magnet. Earth’s magnetic axis, the dipole, is inclined at about 11 degrees to Earth’s spin axis. If space were a vacuum, Earth’s magnetic field would extend to infinity, getting weaker with 
distance, but in 1951, while studying why comet tails always point away from the sun, Ludwig Biermann discovered that the sun emits what we now call the solar wind. This continuous flow of plasma, comprised 
of mostly electrons and protons, with an embedded magnetic field, interacts with Earth and other objects in the solar system. ,
 The pressure of the solar wind on Earth’s magnetic field compresses the field on the dayside of Earth and stretches the field into a long tail on the nightside. The shape of the resulting distorted field 
has been compared to the appearance of water flowing around a rock in a stream. On the dayside of Earth, rather than extending to infinity, the magnetic field is confined to within about 10 Earth radii 
from the center of Earth and on the nightside, the field is stretched out to hundreds of Earth radii, well beyond the orbit of the moon at 60 Earth radii.,
 The boundary between the solar wind and Earth’s magnetic field is called the magnetopause. The boundary is constantly in motion as Earth is buffeted by the ever-changing solar wind. While the magnetopause 
shields us to some extent from the solar wind, it is far from impenetrable, and energy, mass, and momentum are transferred from the solar wind to regions inside Earth’s magnetosphere. The interaction between 
the solar wind and Earth’s magnetic field, and the influence of the underlying atmosphere and ionosphere, creates various regions of fields, plasmas, and currents inside the magnetosphere such as the plasmasphere, 
the ring current, and radiation belts. The consequence is that conditions inside the magnetosphere are highly dynamic and create what we call “space weather” that can affect technological systems and human 
activities. For example, the radiation belts can have impacts on the operations of satellites, and particles and currents from the magnetosphere can heat the upper atmosphere and result in satellite drag 
that can affect the orbits of low-altitude Earth orbiting satellites. Influences from the magnetosphere on the ionosphere can also affect communication and navigations systems. All of these effects are 
discussed elsewhere in more detail.,
 The Earth's magnetic field is generated           in the fluid outer core by a self-exciting dynamo process. Electrical           currents flowing in the slowly moving molten iron generate the magnetic 
          field. In addition to sources in the Earth's core the magnetic field           observable at the Earth's surface has sources in the crust and in the           ionosphere and magnetosphere. The 
geomagnetic field varies on a range           of scales and a description of these variations is now made, in the           order low frequency to high frequency variations, in both the space          
 and time domains. The final section describes how the Earth's magnetic           field can be both a tool and a hazard to the modern world. First of           all, however, methods of observing the magnetic 
field are described.,
 The geomagnetic field vector, B,           is described by the orthogonal components X (northerly intensity), Y (easterly intensity) and Z (vertical intensity, positive           downwards); total intensity 
F; horizontal intensity H;           inclination (or dip) I (the angle between the horizontal plane           and the field vector, measured positive downwards) and declination (or           magnetic variation) 
D (the horizontal angle between true north           and the field vector, measured positive eastwards). Declination, inclination           and total intensity can be computed from the orthogonal components 
using           the equations,
 The International System of Units (SI) unit           of magnetic field intensity, strictly flux density, most commonly used           in geomagnetism is the Tesla. At the Earth's surface the total intensity 
          varies from 22,000 nanotesla (nT) to 67,000 nT. Other units likely to           be encountered are the Gauss (1 Gauss = 100,000 nT), the gamma (1 gamma           = 1 nT) and the �rsted.,
 A geomagnetic observatory is a location           where absolute vector observations of the Earth's magnetic field are           recorded accurately and continuously, with a time resolution of one    
       minute or less, over a long period of time. The site of the observatory           must be magnetically clean and remain so for the foreseeable future.           The earliest magnetic observatories 
where continuous vector observations           were made began operation in the 1840s.,
 There are two main categories of instruments           at an observatory. The first category comprises variometers which make           continuous measurements of elements of the geomagnetic field vector 
          but in arbitrary units, for example millimetres of photographic paper           in the case of photographic systems or electrical voltage in the case           of fluxgates. A fluxgate sensor 
comprises a core of easily saturable           material with high permeability. Around the core there are two windings:           an excitation coil and a pick-up coil. If an alternating current is    
       fed into the excitation coil so that saturation occurs and if there           is a component of the external magnetic field along the fluxgate element,           the pick-up coil outputs a signal 
not only with the excitation frequency           but also other harmonics related to the intensity of the external field           component. Both analogue and digital variometers require temperature-controlled 
          environments and installation on extremely stable platforms (though           some modern systems are suspended and therefore compensate for platform           tilt). Even with these precautions 
they can still be subject to drift.           They operate with minimal manual intervention and the resulting data           are not absolute.,
 The second category comprises absolute instruments           which can make measurements of the magnetic field in terms of absolute           physical basic units or universal physical constants. The 
most common           types of absolute instrument are the fluxgate theodolite for measuring D and I and the proton precession magnetometer for measuring F. In the former the basic unit is an angle. The 
fluxgate sensor           mounted on the telescope of a non-magnetic theodolite is used to detect           when it is perpendicular to the magnetic field vector. Collimation errors           between the 
fluxgate sensor and the optical axis of the theodolite and           within the theodolite are minimised by taking readings from four telescope           positions. With the fluxgate sensor operating in 
null-field mode the           stability and sensitivity of the sensor and its electronics are maximised.           True north is determined by reference to a fixed mark of known azimuth.           This 
can be determined astronomically or by using a gyro attachment.           In a proton precession magnetometer the universal physical constant           is the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton and the basic 
unit is time (frequency).           Measurements with a fluxgate theodolite can only be made manually whilst           a proton magnetometer can operate automatically.,
 The locations of currently operating magnetic           observatories are shown in Figure 1. It can be seen that the spatial           distribution of the observatories is rather uneven, with a concentration 
          in Europe and a dearth elsewhere in the world, particularly in the ocean           areas.,
 Since the 1960s the Earth's magnetic field           has been observed intermittently by satellites. The first satellites           measured only the strength of the magnetic field, sometimes using only 
          a non-absolute instrument, but latterly there have been a number of           satellite missions measuring the full field vector, using           star cameras to establish the direction of a 
triaxial fluxgate sensor.           An absolute intensity instrument is normally also carried and both magnetic           instruments are kept remote from the main body of the satellite by mounting    
       them at the end of a non-magnetic boom. Satellites provide an excellent           global distribution of data but generally only last for a short period           of time, i.e. months to a few years.,

 Satellites which have provided/are providing valuable           vector data for geomagnetic field modelling are Magsat, which flew in           1979 and 1980, �rsted and CHAMP which were launched in 1999 
and           2000 respectively, and Swarm, launched in 2013. Ørsted returned vector data till 2006 and thereafter continued to return scalar data till 2013. CHAMP re-entered the Earth's atmosphere in 
September 2010 after more than 10 years of collecting vector magnetic data. The Swarm mission comprises 3 identical satellites. The �rsted satellite           took  over 2 years to sample all local times 
and flew in the altitude           range 640-850 km. The CHAMP satellite sampled all local times in 4-5           months and flew in the altitude range 330-450 km. Two of the Swarm satellites fly side 
by side at altitudes (late 2014) of about 470 km and the third is at an altitude of about 520 km.  The sampling rate of local times between the lower and upper satellites differs slightly. The lower two 
satellites are intended for very fine resolution of the   magnetic field generated by the rocks in the Earth's crust. The upper satellite provides a   simultaneous measurement at a different location. 
This is important for   identifying magnetic fields generated by the magnetosphere and   ionosphere. ,
 The Earth's magnetic field is observed in           a number of other ways. These are repeat stations and surveys made on           land, from aircraft and ships. Repeat stations are permanently marked 
          sites where high-quality vector observations of the Earth's magnetic           field are made for a few hours, sometimes a few days, every few years.           Their main purpose is to track 
changes in the core-generated magnetic           field.,
 Most aeromagnetic surveys are designed to           map the crustal field. As a result they are flown at altitudes lower           than 300 m, they cover small areas, generally once only, with very high 
          spatial resolution. Because of the difficulty in making accurately oriented           measurements of the magnetic field on a moving platform, these kinds           of aeromagnetic surveys generally 
comprise total intensity data only.           However, between 1953 and 1994 the           Project MAGNET programme collected high-level three-component aeromagnetic           data specifically for modelling 
the core-generated field. The surveys           were mainly over the ocean areas of the Earth, at mid to low latitudes.           A variety of platforms and instrumentation were used; the most recent  
         set-up included a fluxgate vector magnetometer mounted on a rigid beam           in the magnetically clean rear part of the aircraft, a ring laser gyro           fixed at the other end of the 
beam, and a scalar magnetometer located           in a stinger extending some distance behind the aircraft's tail section.,
 Modern marine magnetic surveys are also           invariably designed to map the crustal field but with careful processing           it is possible to obtain information about the core-generated field 
          from the data. In a marine magnetic survey a scalar magnetometer is           towed some distance behind a ship, usually along with other geophysical           equipment, as it makes either a 
systematic survey of an area or traverses           an ocean.,
 Magnetic observations prior to the establishment           of observatories and an absolute method of measuring magnetic intensity           by Gauss in the 1830s were made, amongst others, by mariners 
engaged           in merchant and naval shipping. These are mainly of declination and           extend the global historic dataset back to the beginning of the 17th century.,
 Prior to the 17th century indirect           observations of the Earth's magnetic field are possible from archaeological           remains and rocks using palaeomagnetic techniques. The subject of rock 
          magnetism and palaeomagnetism is outwith the scope of this article.,
 When a rock is formed it usually acquires           a magnetisation parallel to the ambient magnetic field, i.e. the core-generated           field. From careful analyses of directions and intensities 
of rock magnetisation           from many sites around the world it has been established that the polarity           of the axial dipole has changed many times in the past, with each polarity          
 interval lasting several thousand years. These reversals occur slowly           and irregularly, and for a period of about 30 million years around about           100 million years before present, there 
were no reversals at all. In           addition to full reversals there have been many aborted reversals when           the magnetic poles are observed to move equatorwards for a while but           then 
move back and align closely with the Earth's spin axis. The solid           inner metal core is thought to play an important role in inhibiting           reversals. At the present time we are seeing a 
6% decline in the dipole           moment per century. Whether this is a sign of an imminent reversal is           difficult to say.,
 In a source-free region near the surface           of the Earth the magnetic field is the negative gradient of a scalar           potential which satisfies Laplace's equation. A solution to Laplace's 
          equation in spherical coordinates is called a spherical harmonic expansion           and its parameters are called Gauss coefficients. There are internal           or external coefficients, modelling 
the field generated inside or outside           the Earth respectively. A separation of the core and crustal fields,           both internal, is not perfect. The internal field is often called the     
      main field.,
 The main-field coefficients change with           time as the core-generated field changes, and in commonly used spherical           harmonic models, for example the International Geomagnetic Reference 
          Field (IGRF) and the World Magnetic Model, this secular variation is           assumed to be constant over 5-year intervals. It has only been possible           to accurately determine the small 
but persistent field generated outside           the Earth, largely by the ring current, since satellite data have become           available.,
 At the Earth's surface the main field can           be approximated by a dipole placed at the Earth's centre and tilted           to the axis of rotation by about 10�. However, significant deviations 
          from a dipole field exist. Figures 2-11 show maps of declination, inclination,           horizontal intensity, vertical intensity and total intensity at 2020.0,           and their predicted 
secular variations for the period 2020.0 to 2025.0,           derived from the 13th Generation IGRF model. ,
 Using direct observations of the magnetic           field over the past 400 years, the pattern of declination seen at the           Earth's surface appears to be moving slowly westwards. This is particularly 
          apparent in the Atlantic hemisphere at mid- and equatorial latitudes.           This may be related to the motion of fluid at the core surface slowly           westwards, dragging with it the 
magnetic field.,
 The rate of change of declination at Lerwick,           Eskdalemuir and Greenwich-Abinger-Hartland observatory series in the           UK is shown in Figure 12. It can be seen from this plot that there 
have           been a number of changes in the general trend of secular variation in           the past, in particular at about 1925, 1969, 1978 and 1992. These sudden           changes are known as jerks 
or impulses and, at the present time, are           not well understood and are certainly not predictable. Some researchers           have found evidence for a correlation with length-of-day changes.,

 The field arising from magnetic materials           in the Earth's crust varies on all spatial scales and is often referred           to as the anomaly field. A knowledge of the crustal magnetic field 
is           often very valuable as a geophysical exploration tool for determining           the local geology.,
 The anomalies seen at mid-ocean spreading           ridges are of particular interest. At these locations molten mantle           comes to the surface and solidifies to form new oceanic crust, preserving 
          in it the strength and direction of the contemporary ambient magnetic           field. As new material is extruded, the existing crust is pushed away           on either side of the ridge, with 
the direction of the ambient magnetic           field at time of formation frozen into it. Marine and aeromagnetic surveys           reveal a series of stripes in the total intensity anomalies which run 
          parallel to and symmetrically about the central ridge and these are           interpreted as alternating blocks of normal and reversely magnetised           oceanic crust. This discovery of a 
crude tape recorder of the Earth's           magnetic field and its reversals was invaluable to the theory of plate           tectonics developed in the 1960s.,
 The geomagnetic field has a regular small           variation with a fundamental period of 24 hours. This variation is easiest           to observe during periods of low solar activity when large irregular 
          disturbances are less frequent (see section 3.7 below). For this reason it is often referred to as the Solar quiet or Sq variation. Figure 13 shows the actual variation in declination        
   recorded at Hartland observatory on June 22nd, 2004. This graph is typical           of the smooth Sq variation seen at this latitude. Below this is the           variation in a compass needle at Hartland 
over the same period. In reality,           this type of variation in the geomagnetic field would affect the direction           of a compass needle by no more than a few tenths of a degree. Inclination 
          varies by less than a tenth of a degree and the total intensity of the           magnetic field is perturbed by only a few tens of nT, which represents           about 0.1% of the Earth's magnetic 
field strength at Hartland. Although           these effects are very small, they can be of interest to those who use           measurements of the Earth's magnetic field as a tool for very precise    
       navigation (see sections 4.1 and 4.2 below).,
 This regular fluctuation is caused by electrical           currents high in the ionosphere, a region above about 100 km altitude. All currents, like those in wires, can only flow in           materials 
that conduct. The copper used in wires conducts very well           but the air is a poor conductor. However, in the ionosphere high energy           ultra-violet rays and X-rays from the Sun displace 
electrons from (or ionise) the neutral (uncharged) molecules in the air to produce           positive and negatively charged particles (see Figure 14, '+' and '-'           represent the charged particles). 
These charges allow the air to conduct.           At any point on Earth, the Sun is at its most intense around midday           and is therefore generating the most charges in the ionosphere overhead, 
          which allows the air to conduct better. After dusk, in the absence of           ionising radiation, the charges begin to recombine into neutral molecules           again and so the ability for 
the air to conduct is reduced. This cycle           is repeated each day.,
           The sunlight not only makes the air conduct, it also heats it causing           winds. These winds combine with the tidal winds caused           by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon 
and the resulting thermo-tidal winds drive the ionospheric           dynamo. This dynamo generates currents as the conducting ionosphere           is driven through the Earth's magnetic field. These current 
systems           form two closed loops: an anti-clockwise vortex in the northern hemisphere           and a clockwise vortex in the southern hemisphere, like those shown           in Figure 15. Because 
it is solar radiation that produces the charges           that in turn let the atmosphere conduct, the currents remain predominantly           on the sunlit side of the Earth. It is these currents that 
produce the           daily magnetic field fluctuations as the Earth rotates beneath, which           explains why the magnetic field varies throughout the day. The shape,           size and location of 
these vortices also explain why the Sq variation           depends on latitude. As the amount of solar radiation falling upon the           northern and southern hemispheres varies with the seasons and 
solar           cycle, the Sq variation also varies.,
 As well as the regular daily variation the           Earth's magnetic field also exhibits irregular disturbances, and when           these are large they are called magnetic storms. These disturbances 
          are caused by interaction of the solar wind, and disturbances therein,           with the Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind is a stream of charged           particles continuously emitted 
by the Sun and its pressure on the Earth's           magnetic field creates a bounded comet-shaped region surrounding the           Earth called the magnetosphere. When there is a disturbance in the solar 
          wind the current systems existing within the magnetosphere are enhanced           and cause magnetic disturbances and storms. Figure 16 shows a schematic           picture of the solar wind and 
the Earth's magnetosphere.,
 The amplitude of magnetic disturbances is           larger at high latitudes because of the presence of the oval bands of           enhanced currents around each geomagnetic pole called auroral electrojets. 
          Some charged particles get trapped at the boundary of the magnetosphere           and, in the polar regions, are accelerated along the direction of the magnetic field towards the atmosphere and 
finally colliding with oxygen and nitrogen           molecules. These collisions result in sometimes spectacular emissions           of mainly red and green light known as aurora borealis at northern latitudes 
          and aurora australis at southern latitudes.,
 The prevailing conditions in the solar-terrestrial           environment which are a consequence of the emission of charged particles           from the Sun and their interaction with the Earth's magnetic 
field,           is called space weather. There is presently some considerable interest           in forecasting space weather and data from satellites observing the           Sun and the solar wind are 
extremely valuable for this.,
 Although irregular, magnetic disturbances           exhibit some patterns in their frequency of occurence. The main pattern           is the correlation with the 11-year solar cycle and Figure 17 shows 
          the number of magnetic storms per year, from 1868 to present and the           corresponding number of sunspots. Another important pattern is the 27-day           recurrence of some storms related 
to the 27-day rotation of the Sun           as seen from Earth.,
           Figure 17: The annual number of           magnetic storms is represented by each bar of the histogram. Superimposed           is the smoothed sunspot number. The dashed lines indicate solar 
minima           and the dotted lines indicate solar maxima. Note the correlation of           magnetic activity with solar activity and the apparent increase in magnetic           activity with time during 
the 20th century,
 The earliest writings about compass navigation           are credited to the Chinese and date from 11th century A.D.           There is evidence of compasses being used in Europe about 100 years      
     later but the first observations of declination were not recorded until           the 16th century. In 1700 the first magnetic chart, covering           the Atlantic Ocean, was produced by Halley.,

 Contemporary values of declination, or for           some maps the difference between grid north and magnetic north (grid magnetic angle), are           depicted on the majority of modern sea charts, 
topographic maps and           aeronautical charts. These values must be kept up-to-date by regular           revision of the models from which they are derived. This is an example           of the Earth's 
magnetic field being a tool.,
 A specialist form of navigation is directional           drilling in the petroleum industry. There are two main methods of navigation           available for drilling deviated wells towards often small 
targets in           the oil reservoirs. One method makes use of gyro tools but this can           be expensive. The other method makes use of magnetic tools. As accuracy           is critical for economic 
reasons and to avoid well collisions, the accuracy           requirements on the Earth's magnetic field values, used to correct the           direction of the well from magnetic bearings to true bearings, 
are typically           0.1� in direction and 50 nT in total intensity. To attain these accuracies           account must be taken of the crustal field, daily variations and magnetic           storms. 
This application is an example of the Earth's magnetic field           being a tool in the modern world but it can also be a hazard if no account           is taken of these other sources.,
 The most severe magnetic storm in recent           times occurred in March 1989 and this had a number of serious impacts           on technological systems by generating damaging geomagnetically induced 
          currents. In particular, the power transmission system in Quebec, Canada,           was shut down for over 9 hours. Other effects such as increased corrosion           in pipelines are also likely. 
This is an example of the Earth's magnetic           field being a hazard in the modern world.,
 When a magnetic storm is underway the Earth's           atmosphere expands because of heating, and increases the atmospheric           drag on satellites at altitudes below about 1000 km. The orbit   
        of the satellite can be changed and sometimes expensive manoeuvres must           be made to compensate. Other effects on satellites are caused by radiation           hits which can interfere with 
onboard computers. The prediction of magnetic           activity, as a monitor of conditions at satellite altitude, is therefore           of great interest to satellite operators. This is another example 
of           the Earth's magnetic field being a hazard in the modern world.,
 Magnetic field, usually total intensity, traverses and surveys over           an area can aid understanding of the underlying geology and in the case           of iron ore deposits, can indicate very 
clearly their locations. This           is an example of the Earth's magnetic field being a tool but it may           turn into a hazard, especially at high latitudes, if care is not taken           to 
remove the daily variations and magnetic storm effects from the data           before interpretation.,

    The most spectacular view however is from space, where large areas of aurora can be observed simultaneously, even the entire polar cap.  Spacecraft can carry very sensitive cameras, and they often 
use filters to observe the aurora in selected wavelengths, which cuts down interference from scattered sunlight.,
    Such pictures often show a continuous ring of aurora around the polar cap (picture above), caused mostly by electrons leaking out along magnetic field lines, from the plasma sheet of the Earth's magnetic 
tail.  This is the \diffuse aurora\, first identified in 1972 by the Canadian ISIS-2 satellite: being diffuse and spread out, it is not conspicuous to observers on the ground.  Since then, many spacecraft 
have taken pictures of the aurora from above, including the US satellites Dynamics Explorer 1 (DE-1) and Polar Bear, also the two Swedish spacecraft Viking and Freja.  In addition, US Air Force satellites 
of the DMSP series, carrying auroral imagers for military purposes, collected images of auroral arcs as early as 1968.  Three auroral imaging cameras (one using x-rays) are now flying aboard NASA's \Polar\, 
launched on February 24, 1996, and more imagers are planned.,
    Early researchers thought such electrons originated far away (Birkeland believed they came from the Sun). Observations in the early 1970s however led David Evans (NOAA, Boulder) and others to conclude 
that their acceleration took place quite close to Earth, at distances of about one Earth radius (1 RE, 6371 km or some 4000 miles) or less.  The clincher came in 1976 when the US Air Force satellite S3-3 
(peak altitude 8040 km) detected narrow beams of fast oxygen O+ ions rising upwards towards the spacecraft.  Any voltage which accelerated negative electrons downwards would also pull up positive ions, 
and the fact that S3-3 observed such ions at an altitude of 1 RE or so suggested that the process happened closer to Earth than that.,
    How, and why?  Because electrons and ions can slide along field lines like beads, one would expect that any time a voltage difference was created along a field line, particles accelerated by it would 
quickly slide and cancel the voltage, stopping the process.  Hannes Alfven of Sweden (Nobel prize, 1970) and his associate Hans Persson, however, figured out that under proper conditions, the \mirror force\ 
repelling trapped particles from regions of stronger magnetic field could balance this tendency to wipe out all voltage differences. Because the magnetic field is most intense near Earth, the repulsion 
is strongest there too, and the voltage drop balanced by it turns out to be strongest there as well.,
    The preceding however is not enough.  Because the acceleration process adds to the energy of ions and electrons, its energy must be constantly replenished, otherwise it soon runs out. It turns out 
that accelerated electrons usually form part of the circuit of Birkeland currents: whatever drives those currents probably also supplies the energy.,
    Any electric current, like water in a pipe, needs to flow continuously,  without interruption.  If electrons are the main carriers of Birkeland currents  (as observations suggest), they face an obstacle 
when they try to flow from space towards Earth: they must overcome the repelling \mirror force\ which turns back all but a few before they can reach the ionosphere. An accelerating voltage can help the 
electrons overcome this obstacle, and the circuit can provide it, by reducing the voltage driving other parts of the current across the ionosphere, shifting part of the voltage so that it appears along 
the magnetic field lines.,
    However, a thin drizzle of energetic electrons, called \polar rain\ and observed in the dark regions, suggests that ultimately those lines are connected to the interplanetry magnetic field (IMF). The 
lines of the IMF near Earth, at any time, can be directed either away from the Sun or towards it. If some of these lines were somehow connected to the polar caps of the Earth, either the southern polar 
cap or the northern one would have field lines leading to the Sun, while field lines from the other cap would lead into deep space, away from  the Sun.  Satellites have found that the cap which was expected 
to be connected to the Sun also received a much stronger \rain\ of electrons, suggesting that the lines were in fact linked, and that the polar rain came from the Sun.,
    The Earth's rotation around its axis causes it to bulge slightly at its equator. A satellite's orbit usually lies in a flat plane, and the gravity pull of the bulge will tend to rotate that plane slowly 
around the Earth.  A polar orbit passing exactly above the pole, however, is symmetric with respect to the bulge, and does not rotate.  The twin Dynamics Explorer Satellites, launched in 1981, had two 
quite different orbits, but since both were launched in the same plane which passed above the pole, their orbits shared that plane throughout their mission.,
     As the Earth goes around the Sun, the orientation relative to the Sun of such an \exactly polar\ orbit will slowly rotate (though the orbit stays fixed relative to the distant stars).  A satellite 
which starts in the noon-midnight plane will three months later be in the dawn-dusk plane.  Low altitude polar satellites can stop this rotation by using a \sun-synchronous\ orbit tilted a few degrees 
off the pole: the Earth's bulge then rotates the orbit at a rate which is just right for keeping it in the same position relative to the Sun.,
 Below is map of the frequency with which aurora is seen in various polar regions, produced in 1860 by Elias Loomis (1811-1889), professor of natural philosophy at Yale.  The central band has at least 
\80 auroras annually\.,
 One might expect the center of the pattern to be at the magnetic pole, but it is not: the magnetic pole is in northern Canada, while the center of the pattern is near the northwestern end of Greenland. 
The reason is that the Earth's field is not exactly like that of a bar magnet, but contains additional irregularities, more complex and effective mainly near the surface, not far out in space. ,
 In the 1830s a world-wide network of magnetic observatories was set up and it was then realized that disturbances of the compass needle, which were occasionally noticed, occured on a world wide pattern. 
 They seemed to come from outside the Earth, and Alexander von Humboldt named them magnetic storms,
 \Terrella\ is Latin for \little Earth,\  the name given by William Gilbert to a magnetized sphere with which he demonstrated to Queen Elizabeth I his theory of the Earth's magnetism.  By moving a small 
compass around the terrella and showing that it always pointed north-south, Gilbert argued that the same thing, on a vastly larger scale, was happening on Earth, and was the only reason why a compass pointed 
north-south.,
 Later scientists such as Birkeland used the name errella\ for magnetized spheres used inside vacuum chambers, together with electron beams, to study the motion of fast charged particles near the Earth.A 
sophisticated terrella experiment in a vacuum chamber is currently operated by Dr. Hafez u-Rahman at the University of California at Riverside.,
 Students with a more technical background may want to go beyond the introductorylevel of \Exploration.\ A suitable place to start is \A Brief History of MagnetosphericPhysics During the Spaceflight Era\ 
which is also included. Space scientists and graduate students,in particular, will find leads to many key articles in the extensive bibliography of that work.,
 \Exploration\ can provide the outline of a one-semester course on a similarlevel, which might well be called \Space Physics for Poets.\ A teacher presenting such a course needs athorough command of physics 
and some additional familiarity with the Earth-Sunenvironment. The article 'A Brief History of Space Physics During the Spaceflight Era\ included in theseweb files contains a great amount of relevant material, 
and more can be found in its largebibliography and in the file Additional Resources\ reached from the home page of \Exploration.\,
      This uneven rotation, coupled with the churning of the upper layers, mightwell be what produces (by a \dynamo mechanism\, described in a later section)regions of intense magnetic field, seen by observers 
on Earth as dark sunspots.A German amateur astronomer, Heinrich Schwabe, noticed around 1850 that thenumber of such spots rose and fell in an irregular cycle of about 11 years (seefigure below, tracking 
the \sunspot number\ for over a century). ,
      Near the peak of the cycle violent energy releases occur near sunspots,emitting x-rays, radio bursts and rapidly moving plasma clouds, which canproduce magnetic storms when they reach Earth. On occasion, 
especially in largeevents, the releases also produce high energy ions which spread out throughinterplanetary space, to the Earth's orbit and beyond.  Such events are oftenassociated with \flares,\ sudden 
brightenings in the chromosphere, a high layerin the Sun's atmosphere.  The chromosphere is best seen through filters whichonly pass the red light of hydrogen, and it is through such filters that flaresare 
usually seen--though the very first flare observation, by Richard Carringtonin 1859, was made through a regular telescope.,
      Since the Sun's heat comes from its deep core, one would expect thetemperature of its layers to drop with increasing distance from the centralfurnace.  In fact, this does not happen.  While the visible 
face of the Sun (thephotosphere layer) has a temperature around 6000 deg. C, the corona which beginsonly a few thousand kilometers higher reaches a million degrees (1.8 milliondeg. F).  No satisfactory 
explanation has ever been given--somehow, apparently,energy is transmitted to the outer layers of the Sun in ways that go beyond theordinary flow of heat.,
      As the solar wind leaves the corona, it picks up the local magneticfield--contributed by sunspots and by the Sun's magnetic poles--and drags itsfield lines into space, forming the interplanetary 
magnetic field (IMF).  The IMF is quite weak--at the Earth's orbit, only 1/10,000 of the field at theEarth's surface--but as shown in a later section, it exerts an extraordinaryinfluence on the Earth's 
magnetosphere.  ,
      As already noted, field lines in a plasma act like wires on which ions andelectrons are strung.  If the field is strong, these particles are forced to goto wherever the lines guide them.  On the 
other hand, when the particles arenumerous and energetic, as is the case with the solar wind, they can push themagnetic field around.  When their flow is deflected, for instance, the lineswill change shape, 
so as to always thread the same particles.  Because of thiseffect, the structure of the IMF even at the greatest distances tends to\remember\ the Sun's rotation at its region of origin.,
 During magnetic storms, the glow may move southwards, and on occasion it can be seen in much of the US.   It often appears as a glow on the horizon, like the glow preceding sunrise, and has therefore 
become known among scientists as \aurora borealis\ (\aurora\ for short), Latin for orthern dawn.\ A similar phenomenon is also seen in southern polar regions.,
    The aurora--a woodcut by Fridtjof Nansen    To an observer, an aurora is a fascinating spectacle, constantly moving and changing.  It usually consists of many near-vertical greenish rays, forming long 
arcs and curtains, which stretch like ribbons across the sky, often from horizon to horizon.  An example is shown on the right, a woodcut by the great polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen (1861-1930). The rays 
constantly fade while new ones appear, and during \magnetic substorms\ (described in a later section) the arcs move rapidly and expand.,
 Auroral light is produced at a height of about 100 km (60 miles) when fast electrons, arriving from space, slam into atoms and molecules of the atmosphere.  The computer screen displaying these words 
may be lit up in a similar way, by a beam of fast electrons accelerated electrically towards it, then steered and modulated so as to form letters and pictures.,
 The magnetic connection is also demonstrated by the fact that the rays of the aurora lie along magnetic field lines, and that the Earth's magnetic field observed beneath a bright and active aurora tends 
to be disturbed.,
 The green light of the aurora puzzled scientists for many years, since it fit no known element.  It turned out to be produced by oxygen atoms, but under conditions that in our atmosphere only exist in 
the very rarefied upper levels.  A red aurora, occasionally seen, arises at even greater heights and is also produced by electrons hitting oxygen.,
    The spacecraft, named Explorer 1, was launched 31 January 1958 and was designed and built by a group of scientists from the University of Iowa, led by James Van Allen.  That group had been previously 
credited with the first observation of auroral electrons from a rocket; incidentally, the idea of the IGY itself started in 1950 at a dinner party at Van Allen's home (at the time, near Washington).,
    Explorer 2 failed to orbit, but Explorer 3, launched March 26, was successful, and it did carry a tape recorder.  Its trace of the number of counts was normal at low altitudes, then it rose rapidly 
to fill the transmittable limit of 128, but at the highest level it fell to zero.   Laboratory experiments with similar counters confirmed that this was characteristic of extremely high counting rates, 
when the counter discharged so frequently that it could not properly recover between counts, yielding pulses too small to trigger the counting circuit.,
    Sputnik III, carrying more elaborate scientific instruments, was launched May 12 and confirmed the discovery.  It was later realized that Sputnik II had also detected the belt at the highest part of 
its orbit, but that occured above Australia, where the USSR did not track it.  The Australians did get the signal, but the USSR would not reveal to them the broadcast code.  Further studies were conducted 
by Explorer 4 later that year (trapped radiation, history) and of course, by many spacecraft ever since.,
    In our everyday environment, magnetic forces are of no importance and a sensitive instrument, the compass needle, is needed to detect them.  That is because we, the materials we encounter in everyday 
life, even the oxygen and nitrogen which we breathe, are all electrically neutral.  The atoms of oxygen, for instance, contain electrons with negative electric charges and protons which are positive, but 
the two charges balance each other andthe electric and magnetic forces cancel.  Magnetic forces have almost no effect on neutral atoms.,
    However, 60 miles (100 km) or more above the surface of the Earth, the natural environment is quite different.  The fringes of the atmosphere at these heights are strongly heated by the Sun's x-rays 
and ultra-violet light (and by other causes as well), causing negative electrons to be torn off atoms and leaving the remainder of the atoms as positively charged \ions\.  These electrified fragments react 
strongly  to the magnetic forces and can be steered and trapped by them.,
    It can be shown that such free electrons and ions will be guided by  the magnetic field lines (or \lines of force\) which rise from near the southern (magnetic) pole and enter the Earth again near 
the northern pole. Electrons and ions tend to remain attached to field lines like beads on wires, though unlike beads they also slowly migrate (\drift\) to neighboring \wires.\,
    It follows that the structure of field lines near Earth determines much of the motion and behavior of the free electrons and ions found there.  Satellites observing magnetic forces in space have found 
(figure on right) that lines from most points on Earth are confined inside a fairly well-defined cavity, the magnetosphere of the Earth.  The space outside it is dominated by the Sun, and by the fast \solar 
wind\ of free ions and electrons emitted by the Sun.,
  A magnetized bar has its power concentrated at two ends, its poles; they are known as its north (N) and south (S) poles, because if the bar is hung by its middle from a string, its N end tends to point 
northwards and its S end southwards.  The N end will repel the N end of another magnet, S will repel S, but N and S attract each other. The region where this is observed is loosely called a magnetic field; 
a more specific look at the concept of \field\ is provided in a later section.,
 Either pole can also attract iron objects such as pins and paper clips. That is because under the influence of a nearby magnet, each pin or paper clip becomes itself a temporary magnet, with its poles 
arranged in a way appropriate to magnetic attraction.,
 Matter consists of electrically charged particles: each atom consists of light, negative electrons swarming around a positive nucleus.  Objects with extra electrons are negatively (-) charged, while those 
missing some electrons are positively (+) charged.  Such charging with \static electricity\ may happen (sometimes unintentionally!) when objects are brushed with cloth or fur on a dry day.  Experiments 
in the 1700s have shown that (+) repels (+), (- ) repels (-), while (+) and (-) attract each other.,
  Close to 1800 it was found that when the ends of a chemical \battery\ were connected by a metal wire, a steady stream of electric charges flowed in that wire and heated it. That flow became known as 
an electric current.  In a simplified view, what happens is that electrons hop from atom to atom in the metal.,
 Andre-Marie Ampere in France soon unraveled the meaning.  The fundamental nature of magnetism was not associated with magnetic poles or iron magnets, but with electric currents. The magnetic force was 
basically a force between electric currents (figure below):,
 The magnetic property becomes even stronger if a core of iron is placed inside the coils, creating an \electromagnet\; that requires enlisting the help of iron, but is not essential.  In fact, some of 
the world's strongest magnets contain no iron, because the added benefit of iron inside an electromagnet has a definite limit, whereas the strength of the magnetic force produced directly by an electric 
current is only limited by engineering considerations.,
 In space, on the Sun and in the Earth's core, electric currents are the only source of magnetism.  We loosely refer to the region of their influence as their magnetic field, a term which will be further 
discussed later.,
       The magnetic compass soon spread to Europe.  Columbus used it when he crossedthe Atlantic ocean, noting not only that the needle deviated slightly from exactnorth (as indicated by the stars) but 
also that the deviation changed during thevoyage.  Around 1600 William Gilbert, physician to Queen Elizabeth I of England,proposed an explanation: the Earth itself was a giant magnet, with its magneticpoles 
some distance away from its geographic ones (i.e. near the points defining the axis aroundwhich the Earth turns). ,
    On Earth one needs a sensitive needle to detect magnetic forces, and out inspace they are usually much, much weaker. But beyond the dense atmosphere, such forces have a much bigger role, and aregion 
exists around the Earth where they dominate the environment, a regionknown as the Earth's magnetosphere.  That region contains a mix of electricallycharged particles, and electric and magnetic phenomena 
rather than gravity determine itsstructure. We call it the Earth's magnetosphere,
      Only a few of the phenomena observed on the ground come from themagnetosphere: fluctuations of the magnetic field known as magnetic storms andsubstorms, and the polar aurora or orthern lights,\ appearing 
in the nightskies of places like Alaska and Norway.  Satellites in space, however, sensemuch more: radiation belts, magnetic structures, fast streaming particles andprocesses which energize them. All these 
are described in the sections thatfollow.,
      Until 1821, only one kind of magnetism was known, the one produced by ironmagnets.  Then a Danish scientist, Hans Christian Oersted, while demonstratingto friends the flow of an electric current 
in a wire, noticed that the currentcaused a nearby compass needle to move.  The new phenomenon was studied inFrance by Andre-Marie Ampere, who concluded that the nature of magnetism wasquite different 
from what everyone had believed. It was basically a forcebetween electric currents: two parallel currents in the same direction attract, in oposite directions repel.  Iron magnets are a very special case, 
which Ampere was also able to explain.,
    In nature, magnetic fields are produced in the rarefied gas of space, in theglowing heat of sunspots and in the molten core of the Earth. Such magnetismmust be produced by electric currents, but finding 
how those currents areproduced remains a major challenge.,
   Fi    eld lines of a bar magnet are commonly illustrated by iron filings sprinkledon a sheet of paper held over a magnet.  Similarly, field lines ofthe Earth start near the south pole of the Earth, 
curve around in space andconverge again near the north pole.  ,
      However, in the Earth's magnetosphere, currents also flow through space andmodify this pattern: on the side facing the Sun, field lines are compressedearthward, while on the night side they are pulled 
out into a very long ail,\like that of a comet.  Near Earth, however, the lines remain very close to the\dipole pattern\ of a bar magnet, so named because of its two poles.,
    To Faraday field lines were mainly a method of displaying the structure of themagnetic force.  In space research, however, they have a much broadersignificance, because electrons and ions tend to stay 
attached to them, likebeads on a wire, even becoming trapped when conditions are right.  Because ofthis attachment, they define an \easy direction\ in the rarefied gas of space,like the grain in a piece 
of wood, a direction in which ions and electrons, aswell as electric currents (and certain radio-type waves), can easily move; incontrast, motion from one line to another is more difficult.  ,
   A map of the magnetic field lines of the magnetosphere, like the one displayedabove (from a mathematical model of the field), tells at a glance how differentregions are linked and many other important 
properties.,
      Today electromagnetic fields (and other types of field as well) are acornerstone of physics.  Their basic equations, derived by Maxwell, suggestedthat they could undergo wave motion, spreading with 
the speed of light, andMaxwell correctly guessed that this actually was light and that light was in fact an electromagnetic wave.,
   Heinrich Hertz in Germany, soon afterwards,  produced such waves by electricalmeans, in the first laboratory demonstration of radio waves.  Nowadays a widevariety of such waves is known, from radio 
(very long waves, relatively low frequency) to microwaves,infra-red, visible light, ultra-violet, x-rays and gamma rays (very short waves, extremely high frequency).,
    Radio waves produced in our magnetosphere are often modified by theirenvironment and tell us about the particles trapped there. Other such waveshave been detected from the magnetospheres of distant 
planets, the Sun and thedistant universe.  X-rays, too, are observed to come from such sources and are thesignatures of high-energy electrons there.,
    Many people view the polar aurora (orthern lights\) as a rare phenomenon.It is indeed rare at most centers of population, but in Alaska, for instance, orin much of Canada, the aurora is quite common. 
 Its greenish arcs, oftenconsisting of many parallel rays (picture above), may stretch quietly across thesky, with the rays constantly fading as new ones appear.  At other times thearcs may be agitated, 
move rapidly, expand or fade, as if manipulated by anunseen hand.,
      What is the aurora?  Where does its light come from, and what causes it?  Inthe 1800s it was already evident that the Earth's magnetic field was involved:auroral rays seemed to follow the Earth's 
magnetic field lines, and thefrequency with which aurora was observed depended on the distance from themagnetic pole, not from the geographic one.  The typical height of the auroraturned out to be about 
100 km or 60 miles, placing it in the upper fringes ofthe atmosphere.,
      In the late 1800s scientists experimented with electric phenomena in glasscontainers from which most of the air had been pumped out, and produced therebeams of what seemed to be negatively charged 
particles, later named electrons.When electrons hit an obstacle, they can produce light (television screens andcomputer monitors operate that way), leading to the idea that perhaps the aurorawas produced 
like that, too, when beams of electrons from outer space enteredthe atmosphere.,
      The idea gained support when Kristian Birkeland in Norway, around 1895, aimedan electron beam at a spherical magnet and found it was guided towards themagnetic poles of the sphere.  Instrumented 
rockets and satellites laterconfirmed the existence of such electron beams in the aurora, measured theirenergies and even photographed from above the world-wide distribution of aurora.But we are still 
learning about how this happens and where the aurora's energycomes from.,
      Electrons are also most useful in encoding and processing informationelectrically, a field known as electronics.  Nowadays this usually involvestransistors, where electrons are loosely held inside 
a semiconducting material;but at one time all electronic devices--radios, TVs, even earlycomputers--relied on vacuum tubes, in which a hot wire emitted electrons and anarrangement of electrified grids 
and coils controlled their motion. ,
      Short electromagnetic waves carry enough energy to eject electrons from matter, inparticular ultra-violet light and x-rays. A near-vacuum is necessary for anysuch procedure to be effective, because 
in ordinary air free electrons collidewith molecules, lose their energy and are recaptured.  In most of space howevermatter is so rarefied and encounters are so few that free electrons persistfor a long 
time.  ,
     As we climb upwards through the atmosphere, space conditions begin at about 70 km or 45miles, where electrons liberated by sunlight last long enough to allowair to conduct electricity to a significant 
degree.  That is the beginning ofthe ionosphere, a layer with enough free electrons (and ions) to play animportant role in radio communications.  At sunset the electrons of the lowestpart of the ionosphere 
are quickly recaptured and that layer disappears.However, at about 200 km (120 miles), where the density of free electrons is thegreatest (up to a million in each cubic centimeter), collisions are so few 
that the ionosphere persists dayand night.,
      The simplest atom is the one of hydrogen, with just one electron.  Tearingoff that electron gives the simplest ion, the proton.  The proton has a close relative, the neutron--nearly the same mass, 
but no electric charge--andtogether these two form the basic building blocks from which the nuclei of allatoms are constructed.  ,
      Most of the fast ions in the magnetosphere and in the solar wind are protons.In the ionosphere one would expect to see ions of oxygen or nitrogen, the mainatmospheric gases, and in fact most ions 
there are O+, oxygen atoms which havelost one electron (out of eight).  Some O+ ions end up in the radiation belt,greatly energized by magnetic storms.,
      The ionosphere above our heads is a plasma.  Unlike air, it conductselectricity, and in fact, the ionosphere in the polar regions carries largeelectric currents, as is discussed in a later section. 
 The electricconductivity of the ionosphere, unlike that of metals or seawater, is very muchinfluenced by the Earth's magnetic field.  This is a rather special plasma,because the ionosphere also contains 
a fairly high number of neutral atmosphericmolecules, with which the ions and electrons constantly collide.,
      In contrast, collisions are extremely rare in the solar wind.  If this were anordinary gas, or if the Earth lacked a magnetic field, the solar wind would havepenetrated all the way to the top of 
the atmosphere and would then have flowedaround the Earth, the way water flows around a rock in a stream.  Something likethat in fact happens at the planet Venus, which seems to have no magnetic fieldof 
its own.  At Earth, however, a strong magnetic field confronts the solarwind, forming a much bigger obstacle than the Earth itself.  Because the solarwind is a plasma, it is forced to detour around the 
Earth's field, creating alarge shielded cavity around the Earth--the magnetosphere.,
      The explanation of space phenomena thus requires a good understanding ofplasma physics.  Unfortunately, no laboratory can duplicate the large dimensionsand the very low particle collision rates found 
in space plasmas.  The behaviorof such plasmas can be sometimes simulated by computers, but ultimately, tofigure what actually happens, one needs to send instruments into space and studytheir observations.,

 Ever since the launch of the first Sputnik in 1957, space exploration hasadvanced on two fronts, manned and unmanned.  The manned missions are well known--from Mercury, Gemini and Apollo, to the Space 
Shuttle and the proposed Space Station Freedom.  Millions have watched \Apollo 13\ or \The Right Stuff.\,
   In contrast, the exploration of space by unmanned spacecraft has remainedalmost invisible.  The world applauded in 1958, when Explorers 1 and 3discovered the radiation belt, but the many missions which 
followed are virtually unknown.,
    During a total eclipse of the Sun, when for a few minutes the Moon completely covers the Sun's face, a glow appears around the darkened Sun--the solar corona, the Sun's outermost atmosphere.,
    Structures visible in the corona at such times suggest that they are shaped by magnetic fields, and therefore, that the corona consists of plasma.  For instance, short \plumes\  rising from the polar 
regions of the Sun look very much like field lines coming out of the end of a bar magnet, and they therefore suggest that the Sun, in addition to the intense fields of sunspots, also has a global magnetic 
field like the Earth's.,
    Structures observed in the corona above sunspots often have horseshoe-shaped outlines, again suggesting that they follow magnetic field lines.  From the tops of such \arches\ long streamers may extend, 
to distances of the Sun's diameter or even more, looking like pulled taffy, as if some process was pulling material away from the tops of the arches into space, (which is of course what the solar wind 
actually does).   Astronomers have named them \helmet streamers\ because of their resemblance to spiked helmets worn by knights (and also to those used by some German soldiers up to 1918).,
    Unknown spectral lines emitted by the corona were similarly credited to a new element \coronium\ until Edlen showed that they came from the familiar atoms of iron, nickel and calcium, after they had 
lost an appreciable number of electrons (e.g. 13 or 14 for iron). Such high levels of ionization require the atoms to be buffeted around by extremely high temperatures, around 1,000,000 C (1,800,000 F).,

    The source of the corona's heat remains a puzzle.  It is almost certain that its energy comes from the Sun's internal furnace, which also supplies the rest of the Sun's heat.  However, as a rule, temperatures 
are expected to drop the further one gets from the furnace, whereas the million-degree corona lies outside the surface layer where sunlight originates, whose temperature is less that 6000 C.,
    Click  HERE for a full size version   of this image The corona has been observed in these wavelengths by, among others, the space station Skylab in 1973-4 and more recently by the Japanese spacecraft 
Yohkoh, which provided the picture shown below.  The corona in such pictures appears quite uneven.  It is brightest near sunspots, whose arched field lines apparently hamper the outflow of solar wind which 
carries away energy and helps cool the corona.  It is darker in \coronal holes\ in between, where field lines apparently extend out to distant space, making it easier for the solar wind to escape. ,
 Shown here is a map of the frequency with which auroras are seen, produced in 1881 by the German scientist Hermann Fritz (1830-1883). The line of greatest frequency lists 100 auroras per year, while in 
the center of the pattern auroras are much less frequent.,
 If the Earth's field resembled that of a simple bar magnet (\dipole\), its magnetic pole would be near the northwestern tip of Greenland, in the middle of the pattern.  However, the field contains additional 
complex parts, whose effect does not extend as far into space,  and these shift the pole actually observed on the ground to northern Canada, to the location shown on the map.,
      The space shuttle avoids polar orbits, because flying through the aurora exposes astronauts to radiation and creates other problems.  But for studying the aurora, Birkeland currents, polar rain and 
other phenomena related to the distant magnetosphere, such orbits are very useful.  For instance, although the DMSP spacecraft (above) were designed for military needs, scientists have also equipped them 
with magnetometers, particle detectors and other instruments, which have provided a great amount of scientific information.,
    Many spacecraft use such orbits, e.g. the US Air Force surveillance satellites of the DMSP series (successfully adapted to carry science sensors), or the series of French Earth-resources spacecraft 
SPOT. The next generation following DMSP, named NPOEES and essentially dedicated to research, also uses such orbits. The space shuttle avoids polar orbits, because flying through the aurora exposes astronauts 
to radiation and creates other problems.  But for studying the aurora, Birkeland currents, polar rain and other phenomena related to the distant magnetosphere, such orbits are very useful.  For instance, 
although the DMSP spacecraft (above) were designed for military needs, scientists have also equipped them with magnetometers, particle detectors and other instruments, which have provided a great amount 
of scientific information.,
     In fact, although the DMSP mission was originally conceived as a project of the US Air Force, its scientific usefulness has been so widely recognized, that its follow-up will be a joint mission of 
the USAF, NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, successor to the US Weather Bureau) and NASA. Known as the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System or NPOESS 
(\en-poss\) for short, the satellites of that mission, to be launched in the first decade of the 21st century, will carry a sophisticated complement of scientific instruments.,
    The orbital plane of a satellite in space is best defined by its perpendicular direction (its ormal\), defined by distant stars, whose direction on the celestial sphere is fixed.  Because Earth orbits 
the Sun, the angle between the Sun's direction and the orbit's normal slowly changes, increasing by 360° in the course of each year. (The closed path annually taken by the Sun among the stars is known 
as the ecliptic, and 12 constellations along it, named by the ancients, form the zodiac.) If the normal to the orbit of the polar satellite points at the Sun now, three months from now the Sun's motion 
 across the sky will make the normal perpendicular to the Sun's direction.,
      A different choice was made for MAGSAT, orbited 1979-80 to survey the Earth's own magnetic field near its surface.  Magnetic fields from the magnetosphere are a disturbing factor in such a mission, 
a factor that strongly depends on the orientation of the orbit relative to the Sun's direction. By placing the satellite in a sun-synchronous orbit near the dawn-dusk plane (90 degrees to thenoon-midnight 
plane described earlier), not only was the interference kept small, but because the orbit's orientation relative to the Sun did not change, the disturbance also stayed more or less the same throughout 
the mission.,
      On the other hand, the Dynamics Explorer (DE) mission of 1981 used two polar spacecraft, one in a low orbit to intercept the aurora (among other things) and a second one in an elongated orbit to 
observe auroral acceleration and also to take pictures of the entire auroral oval from a distance.  To ensure the best chance for the two spacecraft to intercept the same auroral electron beam at different 
altitudes, it was decided that both orbits would always share the same plane. They were therefore made to pass over the geographical poles:  with any other choice the Earth's bulge would have rotated the 
planes at different rates and they would have soon drifted apart.,
 Experiments with beams of negative particles were performed in Britain by Joseph John (\J.J.\) Thomson, and led to his conclusion in 1897 that they consisted of lightweight particles with a negative electric 
charge, nowadays known as electrons. Thomson was awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize.J.J. Thomson,
 The word \elektron\ in Greek means amber, the yellow fossilized resin of evergreen trees, a atural plastic material\ already known to the ancient Greeks.  It was known that when amber was rubbed with 
dry cloth--producing what now one would call static electricity--it could attract light objects, such as bits of paper.,
 William Gilbert, a physician who lived in London at the time of Queen Elizabeth I and Shakespeare, studied magnetic phenomena and demonstrated that the Earth itself was a huge magnet, by means of his 
errella\ experiment.  But he also studied the attraction produced when materials such as amber were rubbed, and named it the \electric\ attraction.  From that came the word \electricity\ and all others 
derived from it.,
    As a result of those studies, carried out on relatively cool and dense plasmas, scientists nowadays can talk of \Langmuir waves\ and fly \Langmuir probes\ aboard satellites.  Gradually plasma research 
spread in other directions, of which three were particularly significant.,
    Second, astrophysicists recognized that much of the universe consisted of plasmas, and that understanding astrophysical processes required a better grasp on plasma physics.  This was particularly true 
for the Sun, whose intensely magnetic sunspots produced many intricate plasma phenomena (e.g. solar flares).,
    Finally, the creation of the atomic bomb raised great interest in nuclear energy as a possible source of power for the future.  The Sun releases its energy by combining hydrogen nuclei to form helium, 
but this thermonuclear fusion process needs enormous temperatures and pressures, like those found at the center of the Sun.  The process is easier in a gas consisting of the heavy forms (isotopes) of hydrogen, 
but even there, such enormous temperatures are needed that no laboratory container could hold the gas--either the container would vaporize, or (more likely) it would cool the gas to where all nuclear fusion 
stopped.,
    However, since gas at such a temperature becomes a plasma, the idea arose to hold it trapped inside a magnetic field, without it actually touching any material walls.  The effort to produce such \controlled 
thermonuclear fusion\ started with \Project Sherwood\ of the early 1950s and has grown into a great international undertaking, with thousands of scientists and huge, sophisticated machines.  Gradually 
ways were found to foil the different modes by which the magnetic field rapidly spilled its plasma, and both the temperature and density of the plasma were slowly increased.  Recently a fusion experiment 
managed to extract as much fusion energy as was invested in the plasma, but we are still a long way from commercial use of such energy.,
    When satellites discovered the radiation belt and began exploring the magnetosphere, a fourth direction opened, space plasma physics.  From fusion research, space scientists borrowed the theory of 
plasma trapping by a magnetic field, and from ionospheric physics, the theory of plasma waves. Astrophysics provided, among other things, notions of magnetic processes for energy release and particle acceleration. 
 Today space plasma physics is an active field, contributing to the understanding of not just observations in space but also of plasmas in general.,
 The founding of \Project Sherwood\ is described on p. 217-220 of the autobiography of John Archibald Wheeler, \Geons, Black Holes and Quantum Foam\ (Norton and Co., 1998). The book itself tells a fascinating 
and inspiring story, the life of a scientist who was involved in many frontier areas of physics.,
    Cross-section of the two radiation   belts, together with the orbits of    Pioneers 3 and 4 which contributed   early observations of them.   The outer radiation belt is nowadays seen as part of the 
plasma trapped in the magnetosphere. The name \radiation belt\ is usually applied to the more energetic part of that plasma population, e.g. ions of about 1 Mev of energy (see energy units).  The more 
numerous lower-energy particles are known as the \ring current\, since they carry the current responsible for  magnetic storms.  Most of the ring current energy resides in the ions (typically, with 0.05 
MeV) but energetic electrons can also be found.,
  Magnetic field lines similarly describe the structure of magnetic fields in three dimensions.They are defined as follows. If at any point on such a line we place an ideal compass needle, free to turn 
in any direction (unlike the usual compass needle, which stays horizontal--such needles exist, see bottom of page) then the needle will always point along the field line (drawing below).,
 Field lines converge where the magnetic force is strong, and spread out where it is weak.  For instance, in a compact bar magnet or \dipole,\ field lines spread out from one pole and converge towards 
the other, and of course, the magnetic force is strongest near the poles where they come together.  The behavior of field lines in the Earth's magnetic field is very similar.,
 Not so in space, however, where magnetic field lines are fundamental to the way free electrons and ions move.  These electrically charged particles tend to become attached to the field lines on which 
they reside, spiralling around them while sliding along them, like beads on a wire (drawing below).,
 Because of this attachment, the behavior of electrified gas (\plasma\) in space, a gas of free ions and electrons, is dictated by the structure of field lines:   Electric currents, for instance, find 
it easiest to flow along such lines.  Indeed, the role of field lines in a plasma resembles that of grain in wood: just as the grain is the \easy\ direction along which wood splits most readily, so the 
direction of field lines is the one along which particles, electric currents, heat and certain types of waves prefer to flow.,
 A small bar magnet, on gimbals that allow it to point in any direction in space, can be procured from its manufacturer, Cochranes of Oxford, Ltd., Leafield, Oxford OX8 5NT, England. Two types are available, 
Mark 1 with jewelled bearings for $36.60, Mark 2 with simple bearings for $12.65. For details see their web site:     http://www.cochranes.co.uk/secondary.html (scroll down to \Magnaprobe\).,
 The term \aurora borealis\ was used in 1621 by the French scientist and philosopher Pierre Gassendi, but George Siscoe has given reasons to believe it was introduced by Galileo Galilei in 1619 (p. 51 
in \Majestic Lights\, cited below).,
 Elias Loomis of Yale University compiled, in 1860, a map marking how many times in an average year were auroras observed in various locations (click here to see his map).  A more accurate map was compiled 
in 1881 by Hermann Fritz (1830-1883) (click here to see Fritz'es map).,
 However, it was only in 1954 that auroral electrons were actually observed, by detectors aboard a rocket launched into the aurora by Meredith, Gottlieb and Van Allen, of Van Allen's team at the University 
of Iowa. Carl McIlwain, another member of that team, used a 1959 rocket experiment to identify the particles as electrons of an average energy corresponding to acceleration by 6000 volts (see high energy 
particles).,
 Birkeland constructed more than one terrella experiment, including (in 1913) a much larger one in a bigger chamber, shown next to his picture on the current Norwegian 200-kroner bill. That terrella was 
restored in 1995 by Terje Brundtland and is now demonstrated to visitors  at the Auroral Observatory in Tromsø, Norway. For an article about that restoration, see here.,
    In the lower atmosphere where we live, any atom that loses an electron (say, by being hit by a fast cosmic ray particle) soon recaptures it or one like it.  The situation is quite different at high 
temperatures, such as exist on the Sun.  The hotter the gas, the faster its atoms and molecules move, and at very high temperatures, the collisions between such fast-moving atoms are violent enough to 
rip off electrons. In the Sun's atmosphere, a large fraction of the atoms at any time is \ionized\ by such collisions, and the gas acts as a plasma.,
    Unlike cool gases (e.g. air at room temperature), plasmas conduct electricity and are strongly affected by magnetic fields.  The fluorescent lamp,  widely used in the home and at work, contains a rarefied 
inert gas with a fraction of a percent mercury vapor, which produces a plasma when heated and agitated by electricity, from the power line to which the lamp is connected.  The power line makes one end 
electrically positive, the other negative (see drawing below) causing (+) ions to be accelerated towards the (-) end, and (-) electrons to the (+) end. The accelerated particles gain energy, collide with 
atoms, eject additional electrons and thus maintain the plasma, even if some other particles re-combine. The collisions also cause mercury atoms to emit light, and in fact, this source of light is more 
efficient than conventional lightbulbs.  Neon signs and streetlights operate on a similar principle, and some plasma devices are (or were) used in electronics.,
      As noted, the Sun consists of plasma.  Another important plasma in nature is the ionosphere, starting about 70-80 km above ground.  Here electrons are torn off atoms by sunlight of short wavelengths, 
ranging from the ultra-violet to X-rays: they do not recombine too readily because the atmosphere becomes increasingly rarefied at high altitudes and collisions are not frequent.  The lowest part of the 
ionosphere, the \D layer\ at 70-90 km, still has enough collisions to cause it to disappear after sunset. Then the remaining ions and electrons recombine, while in the absence of sunlight new ones are 
no longer produced. However, that layer is re-established at sunrise.  Above 200 km, collisions are so infrequent that the ionosphere persists day and night.,
   The topside ionosphere extends many thousands of km into space and merges with the magnetosphere, whose plasmas are generally more rarefied but also much hotter.  The ions and electrons of the magnetospheric 
plasma come in part from the ionosphere below, in part from the solar wind (next paragraph), and many details of their entry and heating are still unclear.,
    Finally, there exists the interplanetary plasma--the solar wind. The outermost layer of the Sun, the corona, is so hot that not only are all its atoms ionized, but those which have started off with 
many electrons have several of them (sometimes all of them) torn off, including deeper-lying electrons which are more strongly attached.  For instance, characteristic light has been detected in the corona 
from iron which has lost 13 electrons.,
    This extreme temperature also prevents the plasma of the corona from being held captive by the Sun's gravity, and instead it flows out in all directions, filling the solar system far beyond the most 
distant known planets.  Through the solar wind the Sun shapes the Earth's distant magnetic field, and the wind's fast flow (~400 km/s) supplies the energy which ultimately powers the polar aurora, the 
radiation belts and magnetic storm phenomena.,
    No current will flow in this circuit: some atoms or molecules may be left inside the bulb, but they are electrically neutral, and can carry no electric current.  Air is an excellent insulator: electric 
companies can string power lines in the open air and never have to worry about currents dribbling out on their way from the power station to consumers.,
    Suppose the connections of the first battery are reversed, so that now the coil is positive and the plate is negative.  Then no current flows, showing that the hot wire releases only negative particles, 
not positive ones. These particles were named electrons,
     In laboratory experiments these particles were directed by electrically charged structures (similar to the \electron guns\ inside TV picture tubes) to form beams.  Those beams were then bent by magnets 
and by electrified plates, and their behavior was studied.  From such experiments and others the mass of the emitted particles, which became known as \electrons\, could be determined.  It turned out that 
they were rather lightweight. The simplest atom, that of hydrogen, contains a central positive particle, a proton, and a single electron, and the proton is nearly 2000 times heavier.,
    Light, like heat, can also knock electrons out of a metal. If the heated coil in the drawing is replaced by a clean metal plate, and light shines onto it, electrons are again released, and current 
will flow in the circuit.  The explanation of this phenomena, called the photoelectric effect, earned Albert Einstein the 1921 Nobel Prize.,
    The same process will charge a spacecraft orbiting in the sunlight positively, to a few volts. Sunlight knocks out electrons from the surface and a few manage to escape, leaving the spacecraft positively 
charged; the situation then stabilizes, because the positive charge prevents any more electrons from leaving.,
      The artificial radiation belts from the Argus experiment were located in the \slot\ between the two belts and their lifetimes of a few weeks underscored the temporary nature of trapping there (especially 
for electrons produced just above the atmosphere).  In October-November the USSR exploded three rather large bombs in space, in the outer belt region, and their electrons also persisted for a number of 
weeks.  On the other hand, the \Starfish\ H-bomb test, conducted by the USAir Force in July 1962 above Johnston Island west of Hawaii, injected high-energy electrons into the stable inner radiation belt, 
many of them lasting a year or two, some even longer.  The intense artificial radiation belt from that blast disabled three satellites.,
      Nuclear explosions in space were banned in 1967 by an international treaty, but nature itself sometimes steps in.  On March 24, 1991 a strong interplanetary shock, originating on the Sun, hit the 
Earth's atmosphere, compressed it greatly and sent a secondary shock through its interior.  Like surfers riding a wave, trapped electrons and ions rode this shock and within a minute or so created a new 
radiation belt just outside the inner belt (picture below).  The new belt contained both electrons and protons of high energy (15-20 Mev), and it disabled the MARECS-I satellite and degraded GOES-7.  The 
new belt was observed by the US Air Force satellite CRRES and was still in place (somewhat weakened) when CRRES stopped transmitting at the end of 1991. For a more complete story, click here.,
    Cosmic rays are fast positive ions, bombarding Earth from all directions, probably filling our entire galaxy.  Though their numbers are small, the energy of each particle is quite high, so that when 
these ions smash into nuclei of atmospheric gases, fragments go flying off in different directions, some of them short-lived particles created by the collision.  Most such fragments are absorbed by the 
atmosphere or by the ground, but a few are also splattered upwards, out of the atmosphere and into space.,
    If these are electrically  charged, e.g. electrons or ions, they will often end up trapped by the Earth's magnetic field.  None of these however lasts very long, since trapped orbits which rise from 
the atmosphere must sooner or later enter the atmosphere again.,
     The free neutron is however radioactive: within about 10 minutes it breaks up into a proton, which captures most of the energy, an electron and am essentially massless neutrino.  Ten minutes is a 
fairly long time for a fast particle, time enough for many neutrons to get halfway to Mars. However, decay times are spread out statistically, and while 10 minutes is the average, a few neutrons decay 
quite soon, while still inside the Earth's magnetic field.  The energetic protons which then materialize are grabbed by the Earth's magnetic field, often on trapped orbits which do not return to the atmosphere, 
in which the proton can stay trapped for a rather long time.  That, it is believed, is how the inner belt arises.,
      In both a dipole field and the actual magnetosphere, the field lines thatextend to the greatest distances are those which begin or end near the magnetic poles.  It follows that the places on Earth 
most sensitive to distant magnetic effects are the \polar caps\, the regions around the magnetic poles.  A good example is the polar aurora. ,
      If we were to trace back the field lines on which aurora appears (especiallyin substorms), we would probably arrive at the thick plasma sheet (outermost 3 red lines on the right side of the drawing) 
extending downthe tail of the magnetosphere.  Although that is where the process originates, thefinal energization of auroral electrons (as will be explained elsewhere) oftenhappens quite close to Earth. 
 ,
       The narrow auroral oval gives the instantaneous shape of the aurora.  The \auroral zone\ plotted by Loomis and by Fritz is much more smeared out, becauseit is the long term statistical average of 
many aurora observations. During some of them the oval is large, during others it is small, and it can also be displaced towards midnight and in other ways, all of which add up to produce a broad band.,

      Yet something does flow earthwards on those field lines, a thin \polar rain\ of fast electrons, with energies around 500 electron volts (ev).  Solar wind protons have about 1000 ev each, but the 
electrons which move along with them, being about 2000 times lighter, also have a much smaller average energy. Electrons of 500 ev are a completely different population, easily able to outrace the solar 
wind and follow field lines in any direction.  They are too few to produce a visible aurora, but instruments aboard satellites  readily observe them.  They provide the best evidence that the tail lobes 
are indeed connected to the solar wind.,
     All magnetic field lines have a direction, which is why they are labeled by arrows--out of the southern polar cap, and into the northern one.  Similarly, interplanetary field lines also have their 
directions. For about half the time, typically a week at a stretch, they may point away from the Sun, and the rest of the time, for comparable periods, they point towards it (in addition they are twisted 
by the Sun's rotation and by other factors).     Schematic view of the way     polar field lines are linked    to the IMF and to the Sun   When they point away, they can only connect to the northern polar 
cap (drawing), while the bundle of lines coming out of the southern cap by necessity heads into the outer solar system. When the interplanetary field points towards the Sun, the opposite holds and it is 
exclusively the southern polar cap which connects to the Sun.,
      In 1976 it was discovered that when the interplanetary field lines pointedaway from the Sun, the polar rain was much more intense in the northern cap then in the southern one, while when they pointed 
towards the Sun, the southern cap received the bigger share.  Clearly, those electrons must have come from the Sun, and favored the pole with the direct sunward connection.  It was also evident that the 
interplanetary field lines were somehow linked through the taillobes to the appropriate polar caps, although how and where that connection is made is still not known for sure.,
     Elizabeth I  Under Queen Elizabeth I the city became a prosperous center of commerce. The defeat of the Spanish Armada (1588) opened the way to the British settlement of North America, where a short-lived 
colony had already existed1585-7 on Roanoke Island, now in North Carolina. The second attempt, in 1606 at Jamestown Virginia, took root. The big news of 1600 was the downfall of the Earl of Essex, once 
Elizabeth's favorite; he was executed in 1601.,
      The city was congested and unsanitary, and rats carrying bubonic plague thrived in it. Outbreaks usually ocurred in the summer, and at such time the royal court sometimes prudently retreated to the 
countryside. Physicians such as William Gilbert had their hands full, but they could do little and were unaware of the role of the rats. Gilbert, appointed royal physician in 1601, himself died of the 
plague in 1603.,
      Shakespeare's creative genius was in full bloom in 1600. He put on his plays in the Globe theatre, a ring-shaped structure built in 1599 on the banks of the Thames from the remains of an earlier 
theatre. His plays of the 1599-1600 season were Julius Ceasar, 12th Night and As You Like It; in 1600-1 came Hamlet and Merry Wives of Windsor. It is quite likely that Gilbert attended at least some of 
those plays.,
  Variation of the observed \sunspot number\   Vulcan doesn't exist--it was never seen in any total eclipse. However, after a decade and more of diligent observations, Schwabe found something that had 
eluded all astronomers of the preceding two centuries--since sunspots were first reported by Galileo and Christopher Scheiner. He found that the number of sunspots rose and fell in a nearly regular cycle, 
lasting about 11 years. Interestingly, it soon turned out that big \magnetic storms\ when the magnetic field was disturbed (typically by up to 1%) seemed to occur most frequently during the years with 
the most sunspots.,
     The evidence for sunspot magnetism was their emitted light. Glowing gases emit light in narrowly defined wavelengths (i.e. colors), a different set for each substance. In 1897, however, Pieter Zeeman 
found that when such light was emitted from the region of a strong magnetic field, the emission split into slightly different wavelengths, with a separation that increased with the strength of the field. 
The colors of the light emitted from sunspots were \split up\ in just this way. ,
     The method was later improved by Babcock and others, allowing astronomers to observe not only the magnetic field of sunspots but also the weak fields near the Sun's poles. It turned out that the Sun 
has a polar field somewhat like the Earth's, but that it reverses its polarity during each 11-year cycle.,
     Sunspots have also led us to a better understanding of the Earth's own magnetic field. The face of the Sun consists of ionized hot gas (\plasma\), hot enough to conduct electricity. Sunspot fields 
were evidently produced by electric currents, and it was well known that such currents could be generated by a \dynamo process,\ by the motion of an electric conductor (e.g. the flow of solar plasma) through 
a magnetic field.,
     In 1919 Sir Joseph Larmor proposed that the fields of sunspots were due to such dynamo currents. He suggested that a closed chain of cause-and-effect existed, in which the field created by these currents 
was also the field which made them possible, the field in which the plasma's motion generated the required currents. Many features of sunspots remain a mystery, but Larmor's idea opened an era of new understanding 
of magnetic processes in the Earth's core.,
    What if no lodestones existed?  The Chinese would certainly not have invented the magnetic compass. Magnetism would have been discovered much later, and one wonders how. Lacking the compass, the great 
voyages of discovery could hardly have taken place--Columbus, De Gama, Magellan and the rest. The history of the world might have been quite different! ,
   Chemically and mineralogically, the lodestone is magnetite, a massive type of iron ore, an oxide of iron, a mineral related the the brown stuff coating the magnetic disks and tapes used by computers. 
Magnetite is quite common in nature, while lodestones are relatively rare. Why are a few rare pieces of it different from the rest? ,
       Lightning, from the Langmuir Lab  Dr. Peter Wasilewski, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, believes he has the answer.      First, he showed, not all magnetite can become a lodestone: a certain 
composition and crystal structure are required. But even then, just resting a few million years in the Earth's magnetic field would produce no magnetization. ,
   Dr. Wasilewski believes that is what happens when a chunk of the appropriate ore is struck by lightning. Lightning is a discharge of cloud electricity, a large electric current lasting just a fraction 
of a second, but during that time it produces a strong transient magnetic field. ,
   The idea was tested at a unique facility of the New Mexico Institute of Technology, the Langmuir laboratory. That lab, a center of lightning studies, was built on top of South Baldy Mountain near Soccorro, 
New Mexico, the location of frequent lightning strikes. By placing mineral samples where lightning would hit them, Dr. Wasilewski turned magnetite with appropriate crystalline structure into lodestones. 
,
   William Gilbert had a clue to this process, but not surprisingly, he missed its significance. In \De Magnete\ he cited the following passage from a book published in Italy: ,
 In hindsight we would guess that the church tower had been hit by lightning, which magnetized the iron. Gilbert however attributed it to long-term exposure to the Earth's  magnetism, \by the turning of 
its extremities towards the poles for so long a time.\ ,
  \Verticity\ here means magnetization. The observation is quite accurate: above a certain temperature (\Curie point\), iron loses all its magnetism; then, when it is cooled back past that temperature, 
it \captures\ the magnetism existing in its surroundings, due to the poles of the Earth. Its \verticity\ is nowhere as strong as the one produced by a stroke of lighning. Still, as Gilbert observed, in 
a long iron rod that magnetism was channeled to the ends, where it could be noted. ,
    Magnetism \captured\ by hot material that cools down in the presence of the Earth's magnetic influence has played an important role in the more recent discovery of plate tectonics, discussed in a later 
section of this web site. A similar cooling process may also be responsible for the patchy magnetization observed on the surfaces of Mars and the Moon. ,
     Given two magnets, Gilbert knew that magnetic poles can attract or repel, depending on polarity. In addition, however, ordinary iron is always attracted to a magnet--even soft iron, which loses all 
its magnetism again when it is removed again. ,
       Gilbert guessed, correctly, that near a permanent magnet such iron became a temporary magnet, of a polarity suitable for attraction. That is, the end of an iron bar stuck to an S pole of a magnet 
(south-seeking pole) temporarily becomes an N-pole. Because magnetic poles always come in matched pairs, the other end of the bar temporarily becomes an S-pole, and can in its turn attract more iron. ,

       You see this if you dip (say) a horseshoe magnet into a cup with iron pins. As expected. many pins will stick to the poles, but in addition, some more pins will stick to those pins. Yet when the 
pins are pulled loose, they all are seen to be non-magnetic again. ,
       Gilbert confirmed his guess of temporary (\induced\) magnetism by an original experiment (see drawing). Using strings, he hung two parallel iron bars above the pole of a terrella, and noted that 
they repelled each other. Under the influence of the terrella, each became a temporary magnet with the same polarities, and the temporary poles of each bar repelled those of the other one.,
      You will need (1) a small button magnet (drawing), of the type made of steel and used to pin messages to metal partitions in offices (not a flat refrigerator magnet, too weak), and (2) two thin finishing 
nails, the long kind with small heads, about 5 cm (2\) long. If these are not available, find two thin long nails and cut or saw off their heads, leaving equal lengths.,
 Place the magnet on a flat table or the surface of a projector, as drawn, with the attracting pole-ends downwards (the figure is drawn in the plane of the table or projector). Stick the point of one nail 
to the side of one pole of the magnet, perpendicular to it. Restrain the nail with your fingers from moving off-perpendicular, as it tends to do when it tries to increase its surface contact with the magnet.,

 Put the point of the second nail next to it, and use thumb and forefinger to hold the two nails together, parallel. Now separate the fingers slightly, as shown, and note that the ends of the nails repel 
each other, as in Gilbert's drawing. By closing and opening the spacing between thumb and forefinger, you can easily demonstrate the repulsion.,
       Henry Gellibrand (soft \g\) published in 1635 evidence that this difference slowly changed with time. That was an unsettling discovery. It meant that observations of the local compass bearing became 
inaccurate after some decades and therefore had to be repeated from time to time.,
       And from a theoretical angle, how could the magnetic properties of the Earth undergo such gradual change? No known magnet behaved that way. Edmond Halley, of comet fame, came up in 1692 with an 
ingenious explanation. The interior of the Earth, he claimed, consisted of layers, spheres within spheres. Each sphere was independently magnetized, and each rotated slowly with respect to the others.,

       In 1724 George Graham found that the compass needle sometimes veered off by a small angle, for a day or so; a century later Alexander von Humboldt would name such events magnetic storms. That effect 
was widespread: Anders Celsius in Uppsala observed one at the same time as Graham in London, and a century later it was found to be world-wide. Celsius and his student Hiorter also observed magnetic disturbances 
linked to the orthern lights\ (polar auroras); in our time, such events are associated with \magnetic substorms.\,
       All that time, the only kind of magnetism known was the permanent magnetism of magnetized iron or of lodestones. The magnetic force due to the magnetic pole at the end of a magnet seemed a bit like 
gravity or the electric force, growing weaker in proportion to 1/r2, with r the distance from the pole. This \inverse square\ relationship was confirmed in 1777 by Charles Coulomb in France, through experiments 
with a magnetic needle suspended on a twistable string--an instrument which Coulomb introduced, the prototype of most magnetic detectors in the following 170 years.,
       The main difference was that while gravity only attracted, magnetism could also repel. Jonathan Swift (1726) satirically proposed that such a repulsion could act as \anti-gravity,\ keeping an island 
floating in space, as told in the story of the 3rd voyage of \Gulliver's Travels.\,
   The early Chinese also knew about lodestones and about iron magnetized by them. Around the year 1000 they discovered that when a lodestone or an iron magnet was placed on a float in a bowl of water, 
is always pointed south. From this developed the magnetic compass, which quickly spread to the Arabs and from them to Europe. The compass helped ships navigate safely, even out of sight of land, even when 
clouds covered the stars. Compasses were also built into portable sundials, whose pointers had to face north to give the correct time.,
   The nature of magnetism and the strange directional properties of the compass were a complete mystery. For instance, no garlic was allowed on board ships, in the mistaken belief that its pungent fumes 
caused the compass to malfunction. Columbus felt the compass needle was somehow attracted by the pole star, which maintained a fixed position in the northern sky while the rest of the heavens rotated around 
it.,
    And second, the force on the needle was not horizontal but slanted downwards into the Earth. If a compass needle was balanced evenly on its pivot before being magnetized, then afterwards its north 
end would be pulled downwards, and a tip had to be snipped off to restore balance. This was studied by Robert Norman of London, England, who was drawn to investigate this, after snipping off too much of 
a needle he was preparing, and spoiling it. In 1581 he published his finding in a book, The Newe Attractive. ,
      Compass directions above   different parts of Gilbert's terrella        Of his own experiments, the most important was conducted with a magnetized errella\ (\little Earth\), a spherical magnet serving 
as a model for the Earth. By moving a small compass over the surface of the terrella, Gilbert reproduced the directional behavior of the compass; reputedly, he also demonstrated this in front of Queen 
Elizabeth and her court. ,
    The supposed magnetic    attraction of land masses Gilbert ascribed the deviation of the compass needle from true north to the attraction of the continents, which tallied with observations in the Northern 
Atlantic--the needle veered eastwards near Europe, westwards near America. Noting that near the islands of Novaya Zemlaya, north of Russia, the compass needle pointed west of true north, Gilbert speculated 
that a orth-east passage\ around Russia might exist, giving more direct access by sea to the spice islands of the Far East. Some decades earlier, Frobisher and Davis had sought in vain a similar orth-west 
passage\ around the American continent,
        The last of the 6 \books\ into which Gilbert's work is divided deals with the motion of Earth in space and its possible connection to magnetism. Here Gilbert voiced complete support of Copernicus, 
he Restorer of Astronomy,\ which made the book somewhat controversial. Galileo, who praised \De Magnete,\ obtained his copy of it as a gift from \a peripatetick philosopher of great fame, as I believe, 
to free his library of its contagion.\,
    The two fields thus remain separated.  The solar wind pushes back the Earth's field somewhat, but ultimately is forced to detour, leaving the Earth's lines enclosed in a bullet shaped cavity, which 
on the night side continues as a long cylinder, like the tail of a comet.  The boundary surface between interplanetary field lines and those of the Earth is called the magnetopause.,
    This lack of connection insulates the two regions from each other and makes it difficult for the particles and energy to enter the magnetosphere from the solar wind.  One loophole, evident in the picture 
above, are the polar cusps, points on the magnetopause which separate field lines that close on the day side from those swept into the tail.  At the cusps field lines seem to cross each other: that would 
imply a magnetic force which has more than one direction, and the only way it could happen is when the magnetic intensity drops to zero, i.e. there is no field at those points.  Such neutral points are 
the weak spots of the magnetopause. Satellites which have probed their vicinity found disordered weak fields rather than well-defined neutral points, and a \funnel\ of solar wind plasma, penetrating along 
field lines all the way to Earth.,
    The cusps are a relatively minor link between the solar wind and the magnetosphere; a much more significant connection was proposed by James Dungey in 1961.  Dungey noted that the Earth's field lines 
near the ose\ pointed northward, and suggested that when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) pointed southward, or had a southward slant (which grows much bigger when the lines get pressed against 
the boundary), the two opposing fields would cancel out and create a neutral point between them, as in the drawing below, with the point probably extended into a neutral line (a line along which the magnetic 
field intensity if zero) perpendicular to the drawing.,
     The laws by which ions and electrons are attached to magnetic field lines break down at neutral points or line, where the field goes down to zero. If the plasma flows through the neutral line, a process 
known as magnetic reconnection (or magnetic merging) occurs instead.  Interplanetary field lines enter from one side, terrestrial ones from the other, each splits into two parts and the halves then reattach 
in such a way that a northern \open\ line forms, half interplanetary, half terrestrial (see drawing below), and similarly on the southern side.,
    Dungey also suggested that such interconnections were temporary, and that after the particles threading a pair of \open\ lines moved further downstream, the process was reversed at another neutral 
line, somewhere in the far tail.,
    Because open lines extend from the solar wind to Earth, they can effectively transmit plasma and energy from one to the other.  Evidence for this appeared in 1966, when it was found that the degree 
of magnetic \storminess\ tended to be much increased whenever the IMF had a southward slant.,
    Because of the high speed of the solar wind, a bow shock is formed about 3-4 RE outside the nose, like the shock front ahead of a supersonic aircraft.  The solar wind just behind the shock (a region 
called the magnetosheath) is slower, denser and hotter, but as it flows downstream it gradually recovers its normal properties.,
    Satellites which cross the magnetopause into the solar wind often see an abrupt transition, as Explorer 12 did when the boundary was discovered in 1961.  The magnetic field becomes weaker and its direction 
may drastically shift, while the plasma becomes denser and flows rapidly along the boundary, away from the Sun.  Sometimes a boundary layer is encountered between the two regions, a transition region across 
which the field and plasma properties gradually change.,
    The inner magnetosphere contains the radiation belts and the ring current, already discussed.  It extends approximately to synchronous orbit, sometimes further, and compared to other regions it is 
rather stable.,
    The largest features of the tail are two oppositely directed bundles of stretched field lines, nearly parallel, extending from Earth to great distances. Field lines of the northern ail lobe\ connect 
to the vicinity of the northern magnetic pole, and are directed towards the earth, while those in the southern lobe are connected near the southern pole and are directed away.  Sandwiched between them 
is the denser plasma sheet.,
    To produce these deformations of the Earth's nighside field, additional electric currents are required.  It turns out that those currents--quite large ones--flow across the width of the plasma sheet, 
from edge to edge (see preceding drawing). Once the current reaches the magnetopause, it divides into 2 parts which close around the lobes, over the top and under the bottom of the tail.,
    Of all the parts of the magnetosphere the plasma sheet is the most dynamic.  If one traces its field lines back to Earth, one finds that they land in the \ring of fire\ around the pole which is lit 
up by the aurora, the \auroral oval.\ Hence the widespread belief that the aurora comes from the plasma sheet, although some might be linked more directly to the solar wind.,
    James Dungey proposed in 1961 that the Earth's lines could link up with the IMF, producing \open\ lines (field lines with one end connected to Earth and the other to the IMF), which are then carried 
tailward by the solar wind. He also suggested that those lines and their attached plasma (at least in their near-earth parts) sooner or later return to their starting positions, creating a closed cycle. 
 His view was that somewhere in the far tail, northern and southern lines reconnected again, and that the plasma on the reconstituted terrestrial lines then flowed back inside the plasma sheet.,
    Such a process would predict that satellites observing the plasma sheet would always observe its particles flowing towards the Earth. Earthward flows are indeed observed there; but the picture is not 
so simple, because the flows are rather irregular and seem to occur mainly in substorms, described in a later section.,
    The IMP 8 satellite (Interplanetary Monitoring Platform 8) has been on the job for more than 20 years, sweeping around Earth in a big circle, with a radius of about 35 RE.  It continues to provide 
extensive information about the wind, bow shock, and even about the tail, which its orbit also crosses.,
    To provide an early warning about the solar wind, however, the best place for a spacecraft is between the Sun and the Earth.  Luckily, the gravitational pulls of the two bodies allow a spacecraft to 
maintain a fixed position between them, at the \Lagrangian point\ L1 located 236 RE upstream of the Earth, about 4 times the distance to the Moon.  A spacecraft at L1 intercepts the solar wind approximately 
one hour before it hits Earth and thus can give us a one-hour warning of impending changes.,
    For instance, Jupiter's \planetary magnet\ is about 20,000 times stronger than the Earth's, and its radiation belt is not just more extensive than the Earth's but also more intense.  Jupiter has an 
aurora, pictured above as observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (click here for small image; for a bigger version, click here). Jupiter's large moon Io was found to have a remarkable \dynamo interaction\ 
with the planet (details here), and Jupiter's magnetosphere has many modes of radio emissions, first observed in 1955 and still not well understood.,
    As for the rest of the solar system: Venus appears to be unmagnetized, and the solar wind penetrates all the way to an \ionopause\ above its dense atmosphere.  In September 1997 Mars was found by \Mars 
Global Surveyor\ to a weak magnet--just magnetized in patches, though some of them were moderately intense.  Tiny Mercury, visited three times by Mariner 10 in 1974-5, is also magnetic, although its magnetosphere 
is so small that long-term trapping probably does not occur in it.  Mariner 10 did see on its night side what appeared to be an abrupt acceleration event, perhaps similar to a substorm.  The \Messenger\ 
spacecraft, currently on its way, is due to reach Mercury in 2008 and attain an orbit around it in 2011.,
    The Sun, stars and the distant visible universe are mostly plasma, and it turns out that like the magnetosphere, they too can contain high-energy particles, some of them energized above and beyond 
the levels found in the Earth's magnetosphere.  The earliest evidence came from cosmic rays, discovered in 1912 by Victor Hess.,
    It was already noted here that matter conducts electricity only if its ions or electrons (or both) are free to move.  Molecules of air hold on to their electrons rather tightly, so that air is an excellent 
electric insulator. Only the high voltage of lightning can force a current through it!  But the insulation is not perfect: in the late 1800s, scientists were puzzled by the ability of electric charge--e.g. 
on a charged electroscope --to gradually leak away through the air.  The discovery of radioactivity in 1895 provided an explanation: traces of radioactive elements in the ground emitted fast particles 
and gamma rays, and these tore electrons off atoms--temporarily, true, but it was enough to support a small leakage current.,
    Strangely, however, the effect seemed more pronounced atop high mountains.  Victor Hess took his instruments aboard a balloon, and noticed that the higher the balloon rose, the greater was the leakage 
rate.  Obviously, whatever radiation was responsible came not from the ground below but from space above, and it was therefore named \cosmic radiation.\  The higher the balloon flew, the less of the atmosphere 
the observed radiation had to pass through, and the more intense was its effect.,
    Early researchers thought that the radiation consisted of gamma rays, the most penetrating type then known, but it turned out to be affected by the Earth's magnetic field, suggesting charged particles. 
After World War II unmanned balloons were used to lift special photographic emulsions to the top of the atmosphere, to observe the \primary radiation\ (on the ground we get mostly fragments from its collisions). 
 They found that it consisted of the ions of common matter--mostly hydrogen, some helium, lesser amounts of heavier elements, in proportions not radically different from those found on the Sun, but their 
energies, compared to those of atoms and ions elsewhere, were enormous.,
    How enormous?  One yardstick for measuring the energy of motion (\kinetic energy\) carried by a fast ion or electron of mass m, is the \rest energy\ E = mc2 assigned to the particle by the theory of 
relativity.  The kinetic energy of a satellite in a near-Earth orbit (having ten times the speed and, weight for weight, hundred times the energy of a rifle bullet) is just a tiny part, less than one billionth 
of its mc2.  For the slowest cosmic rays, on the other hand, the energy of motion is about equal to mc2, while at the top of the observed range it is at least a billion times larger.,
    How do cosmic rays gain such tremendous energies?  In truth we don't know, although theorists tend to credit supernova explosions, which produce powerful expanding shock fronts.  The figure above, 
taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, shows the remnant of such a supernova, observed in 1987, and the small bright circle is its spreading shock (the bigger circles must have been emitted earlier).  It 
is hard to check out such theories, and the directions from which cosmic rays arrive do not tell anything, for they cover the sky evenly, having been thoroughly scrambled by galactic magnetic fields.  
 Shock acceleration can however be observed in the Earth's magnetosphere, e.g in the remarkable event of March 24, 1991, and that suggests our nearby \space plasma lab\ may have something to say about 
cosmic rays, too.,
    High-energy particles in distant space also announce their presence through x-rays and gamma rays.  Like all electromagnetic waves (including light) these radiations can only transmit their energy 
in well-defined packets, known as \photons.\  Each photon is furthermore emitted by a single particle, and since the photons of x-rays and gamma rays are rather large, particles that emit them need a hefty 
amount of energy to begin with.  Some distant sources of x-rays and gamma rays emit very brief and quite intense bursts of radiation, confronting astronomers with yet another mystery.,
    The Sun also accelerates electrons, apparently in greater numbers but to lower energies.  Being lighter, they are more tightly held by local magnetic field lines and often, unable to escape, they produce 
intense bursts of x-rays.  The figure above, from the Japanese Yohkoh satellite, gives the image of such an x-ray emission, at the top of an arching bundle of field lines.,
    Solar energetic ions were first observed in the 1940s, and the ideas of magnetic reconnection and its release of magnetic energy were originally formulated to explain their existence.  Unfortunately, 
reconnecting field lines are invisible, and the region where reconnection is supposed to happen on the Sun is hard to observe.  It may therefore be quite relevant that similar processes have been observed 
in substorms in the magnetospheric tail.  True, substorms are still a puzzle, too, but at least they take place within reach of scientific satellites.,
 It was believed that the inside of the Earth was magnetized in the same fashion, and scientists were greatly puzzled when they found that the direction of the compass needle at any place slowly shifted, 
decade by decade, suggesting a slow variation of the Earth's magnetic field.,
 How can an iron magnet produce such changes?  Edmond Halley (of comet fame) ingeniously proposed that the Earth contained a number of spherical shells, one inside the other, each magnetized differently, 
each slowly rotating in relation to the others.,
 Hans Christian Oersted was a professor of science at  Copenhagen University.  In 1820 he arranged in his home a science demonstration to friends and students.  He planned to demonstrate the heating of 
a wire by an electric current, and also to carry out demonstrations of magnetism, for which he provided a compass needle mounted on a wooden stand.,
 While performing his electric demonstration, Oersted noted to his surprise that every time the electric current was switched on, the compass needle moved.  He kept quiet and finished the demonstrations, 
but in the months that followed worked hard trying to make sense out of the new phenomenon.,
 But he couldn't!  The needle was neither attracted to the wire nor repelled from it.  Instead, it tended to stand at right angles (see drawing below).  In the end he published his findings (in Latin!) 
without any explanation.,
 André-Marie Ampére in France felt that if a current in a wire exerted a magnetic force on a compass needle, two such wires also should interact magnetically.  In a series of ingenious experiments he showed 
that this interaction was simple and fundamental--parallel (straight) currents attract, anti-parallel currents repel.The force between two long straight parallel currents was inversely proportional to 
the distance between them and proportional to the intensity of the current flowing in each.,
 (it gets further complicated if the currents flow in directions inclined to each other by some angle). To find then the force between wires of complicated shape that carry electrical currents, all these 
little bitty contributions to the force must be added up. For two straight wires, the final result is as above--a force inversely proportional to R, not to R2],
 There thus existed two kinds of forces associated with electricity--electric and magnetic.  In 1864 James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated a subtle connection between the two types of force, unexpectedly involving 
the velocity of light.  From this connection sprang the idea that light was an electric phenomenon, the discovery of radio waves, the theory of relativity and a great deal of present-day physics.,
 --\From Falling Bodies to Radio Waves\  by Emilio Segre, W.H. Freeman and Co., 1984, gives a very good account of the history of electricity and magnetism (and of physics up to 1895).  Segre, who won 
the Nobel prize in physics, wrote in a clear style with many insights and anecdotes about the discoveries which laid the foundations of physics.,
       It is hard to teach your students about those subjects, unless both you and they have a clear understanding of the nature of magnetism. (One can also argue, that one reason for teaching about the 
magnetosphere is, to make the study of magnetism more interesting!),
       I regret to say that even in this day and age, most of the public regards magnetism as a mystery. That has led to magnetic bracelets and similar \health products,\ to magnets taped to fuel lines 
for better gas mileage, and to widespread worries about possible reversal of the Earth's field, encouraged by Hollywood movies.,
        In the minds of most Americans magnetism is forever associated with specially treated iron, with patterns of iron filings and with the way the compass needle lines up with the north-south direction. 
Few schools teach much more, because, (1) physics is an elective, and (2) magnetism is covered near the end of the textbook, the school year is short, and teachers are happy if they just make it to Ohm's 
law.,
       Some people may also know that a current-carrying wire coil wrapped around an iron bar turns it into a magnet, and about use of electromagnets in electric machinery.  But it's always with iron, 
or with some magnetic substance. Why sunspots would be magnetic remains completely unclear. To help you bring a little more understanding to your classes, I'll try give here a crash course on some basic 
magnetic phenomena, with a few of quick classroom demonstrations. (Slide 1),
     In ancient times, both Greeks and Chinese knew about natural magnets, rare chunks of iron-rich mineral known as lodestones.  The Chinese also knew that if you rubbed a steel needle against a lodestone, 
in a fixed direction, it also became a magnet.  Around the year 1000, they furthermore found that if a magnet or lodestone was placed on a little \boat\ floating in a bowl of water, it always pointed in 
a fixed direction--and for a magnetized iron bar, that direction was always north-south.  You could rotate the bowl, but the magnet would keep pointing in the same direction.,
       The reason, we now know, is that the Earth, too, is magnetic.  From that came the magnetic compass, quickly copied by Arab navigators and then by Europeans.  We may wonder today--if lodestones did 
not exist, the compass might have stayed undiscovered for a long time, and would Columbus have ventured so far from land without it?,
     You can demonstrate this to the class on top of a projector, using a transparent compass--the kind one can place on top of a map to orient it. I have one here with me.  ,
        However, it is much more impressive to float a small magnetized sewing needle in a Petri dish containing water, on top of that projector. It helps prevent spills if the dish has a cover, which 
you remove after it is safely on top of the projection glass; or else, fill it (from a cup) after placing it on the projector, to a depth of about 7-8 mm. Have a larger container to take the water afterwards, 
and just in case, also keep some paper towels on hand.,
        The needle should be the thinnest you can get--a small needle of about 3 cm is OK, heavier ones tend to sink. It should be dry, and handling it helps, as it rubs off some grease from the fingers. 
Magnetize it by stroking with a magnet--the button magnet used in the next demonstration can serve here.,
       Get several needles, just in case the first one sinks; it may be harder to float a needle again after it gets wet, although a paper towel can help dry it. .Have a small magnet on hand to magnetize 
the needle. ,
     The needle won't sink if you drop it carefully. Hold it horizontally at its middle between two fingers, just above the water, then let go. (Use fingers, not pincers: a lot of those are of iron, and 
the needle may stick magnetically). ,
       Of course, it then points north-south, as you can show by placing the transparent compass (used below in another demonstration) on the same projector top. Not too close, or the two magnetic needles 
interact. (Also, make sure the auxiliary magnet is well away, or else  orth\ may be in some funny direction),
        But why does it float?  Ah, now you can tell students about surface tension, about the thin \skin\ of the top layers of water molecules, which stick together, and about water beetles which scurry 
over the tops of quiet ponds.,
      But back to magnetism, although this is mainly about explaining a very fundamental concept in science--the experiment.  A scientific experiment is a way of testing nature, to learn how it behaves. 
,
       By 1580, the use and manufacture of compass needles was a well known art. The maker would take a flat steel needle, find its middle by balancing it, install a pivot there, and then magnetize it 
by stroking it against a magnet or a lodestone. But that was not enough. The north-pointing end always seemed heavier, and a tip had to be snipped off, to make the needle balance again.,
       The story goes that a compass maker named Robert Norman once snipped off too much and ruined a needle, so he devised an experiment, to find what was happening.  Before magnetizing the needle, he 
balanced it not on a vertical pivot but on a horizontal one, lined up in the east-west direction. (Slide 4, above). Before the needle was magnetized, it stayed horizontal. Afterwards,  its north end slanted 
down. (For some reason, the needle in Figure 4 points straight down, as it would at the magnetic pole.) Aha!  The north-pointing magnetic force on the needle was not horizontal, but pointed into the Earth. 
,
       It was a classical scientific experiment, one of the first, and was published in 1581.  Norman's contemporary was William Gilbert,  distinguished physician and later physician to Queen Elizabeth 
I. Gilbert devoted much of his energy and money to study magnetism, and in 1600 published his research in a book \De Magnete\ (Latin for \On the Magnet\). The preciding visualization of the downward \dip 
angle\ of the magnetic force (Slide 5) is from this book.,
      Gilbert devised an experiment which suggested a reason for the properties of the compass: the Earth itself was a giant magnet. Using as model for the Earth a lodestone fashioned into a sphere (he 
named it errella\ or \little Earth\), Gilbert reproduced not only the north pointing properties of the horizontal needle, but also the downward slanting of the needle which Robert Norman made. (Slide 6),

       You will find two reviews of Gilbert's book and a lot more, including most of what I am telling here today, in my web course on Earth magnetism, \The Great Magnet, the Earth\ With home page http://www.phy6.org/earthgmag/demagint.htm 
. Time is short, so let me just reproduce another projector-top experiment,  following an idea of Gilbert.,
        If you dip a bar magnet into a cup of nails, nails will stick to it.  But exactly, why? You know that magnets attract iron, but then you also note, some nails stick to other nails. Why that? ,

         Gilbert guessed that the reason was that ordinary iron turned into a magnet whenever it touched another magnet.  Soft iron (not steel) loses its magnetism once it is taken away, but while in contact 
with a magnet, he proposed, it too acts like a magnet, and its polarity is always in a direction which helps it stick to the first magnet. Thus one nail attracts another.,
        He proved his hunch by showing that such temporary magnets not only attracted, but could also repel. He did this by an experiment shown on the above drawing, the frontpiece of his book: the soldier 
on the right holds two pieces of iron suspended together from strings, just above a magnetized sphere.  Their free ends here seem to repel. In actual practice this does not work too well, so we demonstrate 
the same effect in a somewhat different way. ,
     Here is how you perform the experiment in class. Put a magnet on top of the projector, and allow two small nails to attach themselves to adjacent spots on one of the poles, with your fingers holding 
them parallel to each other.,
       Both nails are now temporary magnets with the same polarity--say, north-seeking or N--at the ends next to the magnet.  The polarities of their other ends therefore must be the same--here, south-seeking 
or S, and those ends should repel each other.  By spreading your fingers and allowing the ends of the nails to move apart, you can show that in fact they do. (Slide 7),
     Your students will now understand why iron filings on a paper sheet above a magnet line up the way they do. Each little piece becomes a temporary magnet, and like a tiny compass needle, it lines up 
with the direction of the magnetic force.,
     Let me quickly jump to the year 1820, not long after the invention of electric batteries. Electric currents were a hot scientific topic, but no one suspected they had anything to do with magnetism. 
(Slide 9--Oersted's discovery),
       A Danish professor, Hans Christian Oersted, prepared for some friends a science demonstration in his home.  It included the heating of a wire by an electric current from a battery, and also some 
demonstrations of magnetism, using a compass on a stand.,
       While carrying out the heating experiment, Oersted noted that every time he connected the current, the compass needle moved, too, something completely unexpected. No one else took notice.  In the 
four months that followed he tried hard to make sense of the phenomenon; but he couldn't! The compass needle was neither attracted nor repelled, but tended to stand perpendicular to the wire. In the end 
he could only report his observations in an article--written in Latin, no less.,
       Following Oersted's article, the effect was confirmed all over Europe, and André-Marie Ampére in France figured it out, using some clever experiments. Magnetism, he claimed, was basically the force 
between electric currents. Parallel currents attract, anti-parallel currents repel. Loops of current attract or repel like magnets, coils with many loops multiplied the magnetic force, and Ampére guessed 
that iron atoms were magnetic because electric currents (soon named \Ampére currents\) circulated in them.  An electron orbiting in an atom can carry such a current, although we know now that the actual 
explanation, involving electron spin, is more complicated.,
     You can perform Oersted's experiment on top of a projector, using just a transparent compass, a D-cell and a short (say, 9\), thick, flexible insulated wire. (insulated--just in case it gets hot). 
The D-cell should be fresh: you will have to draw a large current from it, a short circuit really, though only for a very short time.  ,
         Put the compass on the glass, and let everyone see that it points north. Then with your thumb press one end of the wire against the bottom of the D-cell. The wire should form a short loop, coming 
back to the other terminal of the battery, but not touching it.,
       Maneuver the wire so that the middle of the wire passes over the compass needle and is parallel to it. Then touch the other end of the wire to the other end of the cell--just a short touch (1-2 
seconds), it's a short circuit and not good for the cell, also it generates a lot of heat at the contacts. The needle will immediately pivot to stand at 90 degrees to the wire.  ,
     By the way, Gilbert might have had a clue to this effect (this is on the web too, at http://www.phy6.org/earthmag/lodeston.htm). In some book he read a report from Italy, of an iron rod set in a steeple, 
which was found bent.  It was taken down and brought to a blacksmith to be straightened out, and was then found to be strongly magnetic. We today would guess it was magnetized (and also bent) by lightning, 
which carries a strong (but brief) electric current.  In fact, it is believed that magnetization by lightning (when it strikes some special iron-bearing minerals) is also what produces lodestones, but 
for that, again, see above web page.,
     All you have heard here is just the bare beginning of teaching magnetism. I hope it is not too much to put in your science course--and at the same time, I hope there is enough here to arouse the interest 
of bright students and to make some of them, perhaps, explore magnetism on their own.,
 Over much of the Earth's surface, compass needles point roughly north. However, because of the complex shape of the Earth's magnetic field there are few places where a compass needle will point exactly 
north. A compass lines up with the horizontal component of the magnetic field in a direction called magnetic north. True north, on the other hand is the direction from a given location to the north geographic 
pole. The angle between magnetic north and true north is called magnetic declination. Many people believe that a compass needle points at the North Magnetic Pole. This is not true; if you follow your compass 
needle you will eventually arrive at the North Magnetic Pole, but not by the most direct route.,
 Both declination and variation are used to describe the angle between magnetic north and true north. The term deviation is also used from time to time. Here is an explanation of the differences between 
the three terms.,
 The first known determination of magnetic declination was made by the Chinese in about 720 AD. In Europe, the concept of declination was known in the early 1400s, but the first precise measurement of 
declination was not made until 1510, when Georg Hartman determined the declination in Rome. The importance of declination for navigation was obvious. Mariners quickly devised methods for determining it 
and began compiling declination values from locations around the world. In 1700 Edmund Halley came up with the idea of showing declination as contour lines on a map ; he used this novel concept to produced 
the first declination chart of the Atlantic Ocean. Declination charts have been produced on a regular basis ever since.,
 The secular variation of the magnetic field causes declination to change with time. Changes in declination can be quite large. At Yellowknife, NWT, for example, the declination is changing by more than 
one degree every three years. On the other hand, at Ottawa, the yearly change in declination is almost zero. The diagram shows the change in declination at several locations in Canada.,
 Magnetic declination also undergoes changes that are much more rapid than secular variation and are a result of magnetic activity. These variations can be smooth and cyclic, with amplitudes of several 
minutes of arc in southern Canada, or, during magnetic storms, large and erratic. Changes in declination become increasingly irregular in both amplitude and frequency as one approaches the North Magnetic 
Pole, a result of the weak horizontal component of the magnetic field. The number of times per year that a compass user will be affected by changes in declination caused by magnetic storms will depend 
both on the user's application and location. The diagram shows the percentage of days in a typical year during which magnetic declination will fluctuate by more than a given amount from its normal value.,

 Most standard orienteering compasses have a precision of about 2 degrees. It can be seen that in Southern Canada users of such compasses will seldom experience fluctuations larger than 2 degrees. However, 
someone on a canoe trip in the NWT would find his or her compass in error by more than 2 degrees on more than 1 day in 4.,
 Canadian topographic charts contain a diagram in the margin which gives the declination for the year in which the chart was published. Beneath the diagram is a statement informing the user about the annual 
change of declination. By multiplying the annual change by the number of years that have elapsed since the chart was published and adding the total change to the published declination value, the user obtains 
the present day declination.,
 It is important to remember that the annual change does not remain constant with time. Therefore, using the annual change to update the declination on an old map is likely to result in an error in the 
updated declination.,
 It is also important to know that the declination shown in the diagram on the topographic map is not the true declination. Declination is defined as the angle between magnetic north and the true north. 
However, the diagram on the topographic map sheet gives the value of the angle between magnetic north and grid north, which is referenced to the grid lines shown on the map. This angle is properly called 
grid declination. The angle between grid north and true north is called the convergence angle. To obtain the true declination it is necessary to add or subtract the convergence angle to the Grid Declination. 
The diagram illustrates four possible combinations.,
 Declination is also shown on aeronautical charts as contour lines and on hydrographic (marine) charts either as contour lines or in the form of a compass rose, depending on the scale of the chart. In 
all cases, true declination is given.,
    The orbits Stoermer was most concerned with belonged to particles with rather high energies. In general they did not resemble tidy spirals, because they covered large sections of the magnetic field, 
and in the course of each excursion around the field, the intensity and direction of the magnetic field did not stay the same but varied appreciably.  Later, when cosmic rays were discovered, it turned 
out that Stoermer's theory applied quite well to their motion: but it did not solve the mystery of the polar aurora, as Stoermer had hoped.,
    Meanwhile in the 1950s efforts began to confine plasma in laboratory magnetic fields for producing controlled nuclear fusion, and in the process the theory of trapped particles was greatly developed 
and expanded.,
    As a grand experiment he proposed in October 1957 to the US Air Force to launch rockets with small atomic bombs, and detonate them in space. Atomic bombs produce large numbers of energetic electrons, 
and Christofilos hoped that such electrons would become trapped in the magnetic field as an artificial radiation belt.,
    That project, conducted in secrecy and code-named Argus, received a great boost when Van Allen's Explorers 1 and 3 discovered the natural radiation belt, and it was carried out above the Southern Atlantic 
in August and September 1958.  Three bombs were exploded outside the atmosphere, above a deserted stretch of ocean, and the public only learned about it the following year, when many related scientific 
studies were published.,
    A more frequent type of disturbance, and perhaps a more fundamental one, is the magnetic substorm (its relation to magnetic storms is discussed further below).  Many features of the substorm remain 
to be explained, but it is widely held to represent the violent discharge of magnetic energy, accumulated in the tail of the magnetosphere.,
    Substorms were recognized much later than magnetic storms, because their effects are observed on the ground mainly in the auroral zone. After observing a great auroral display in Connecticut on July 
1, 1837, E.C. Herrick wrote (italics in the original):,
    As the Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland observed around 1900, those \fits of maximum intensity\ also created magnetic disturbances on the ground.  After analyzing them with a network of four 
stations, he concluded that they came from large electric currents flowing along the auroral arcs. Birkeland regarded them as a new phenomenon, which he named an \elementary polar magnetic storm\ and which 
typically lasted half an hour.,
    In 1964 S.-I. Akasofu named them \magnetic substorms,\ a term originally introduced by his mentor Sidney Chapman, who viewed them as phases of magnetic storms. Akasofu noted that they often occured 
independently of storms and that tended to follow a certain pattern--the aurora brightened, its arcs moved rapidly and spread across the sky (especially polewards), then broke up and dwindled away.  The 
associated magnetic disturbance could be quite large, maybe 3-10 times that of magnetic storms, but it dropped down quickly outside the auroral zone, implying that it was produced by nearby electric currents, 
as Birkeland had also concluded.,
    Satellites in space see much more profound changes than the ground observer.  The number of particles observed on the night side, in synchronous orbit and in the tail, may increase a hundred-fold and 
more, or else the particles may disappear altogether, suggesting a drastic re-shaping of magnetic field lines.  Images from satellite cameras show a band of active and bright aurora over the night side 
of the polar cap, low-altitude satellites passing that band intercept intense flows of electrons, and satellites in the plasma sheet detect fast and abrupt ion flows.,
    All this suggests that the substorm accelerates ions and electrons to higher energies, and for this it has received more attention than any other magnetospheric phenomenon.  Scientists believe that 
like a flare on the Sun, the substorm represents the sudden conversion of magnetic energy to particle energy, and in fact the name \auroral flare\ was once suggested.  Many also believe it to be associated 
with magnetic reconnection, a process originally proposed for flares but later applied to the Earth's magnetopause.  Yet much is still uncertain, in part because most data on substorms in space come from 
isolated spacecraft which cannot see the full pattern, and several rival theories of the substorm still exist.,
    They represent a new and altogether different type of electric current in space. Other currents described so far--the ring current, the current on the magnetopause which confines the Earth's field, 
and the plasma sheet current which flows across the tail--all are \coasting currents\ and (in principle) consume no energy.  As long as a plasma is present in a suitable magnetic field, the spiraling and 
drifting motions of its ions and electrons automatically produce the electric current flow.,
    Electric currents which flow in and out of the ionosphere are more like house currents, which need a voltage (a kind of electrical pressure) to drive them through wires and appliances, and which do 
transmit energy.  Indeed, Birkeland currents might be one of the avenues by which the magnetosphere extracts energy from the solar wind.  It is time for a closer look at the processes involved.,
    \Dynamo processes\ can also exist when the circuit is formed by a plasma, part of which flows across a magnetic field,  e.g. plasma of the ionosphere or the magnetosphere.  In particular, if some of 
the Earth's magnetic field lines are \open\ and extend into the solar wind, a dynamo circuit should exist: it would include (picture below) a path in the ionosphere between two open field lines, the lines 
themselves, and a closure path in the solar wind. Since the solar wind moves relative to the ionosphere (or vice versa), the conditions for a dynamo exist and a current is expected to flow; as part of 
the process, the solar wind in the distant leg of the circuit is slightly slowed down, and this supplies the energy needed to produce the current.  Such a \dynamo\ may in fact explain at least some of 
the Birkeland currents.,
    The acceleration of these new ions and their injection into the ring current is accompanied by large and violent substorms.  The auroral region expands, allowing aurora to be seen equatorward from 
its usual location.  That is the reason why many people associate auroras with magnetic storms!,
    We still do not know why substorms occuring in magnetic storms differ from the usual type, why they inject much more plasma into the inner magnetosphere and to a much greater depth.  For one thing, 
\ordinary\ substorms are triggered by relatively moderate changes in the solar wind or IMF, and may even erupt spontaneously if favorable conditions exist.  Full-size magnetic storms always require a strong 
interplanetary stimulation--the arrival of a fast and dense plasma cloud, launched by a solar eruption (the cloud's magnetic field should have a southward slant), or of a fast stream of the solar wind. 
 They are relatively infrequent, occuring perhaps once or twice a month--nothing like Herrick's four-hour interval, cited at the start of this section.,
    You may have noticed in the drawing (reproduced here) that the circuit of the fluorescent light fixture included a \ballast coil.,\ You might also have noticed such coils in fixtures in your home, 
often encased in a rectangular box. Ordinary hot-filament lightbulbs are connected directly to power lines, but fluorescent lamps always receive their current through a ballast. Why? ,
     Good question. If you have studied electricity, you surely learned there about Ohm's Law, by which the current flowing through a device is inversely proportional to its electrical resistance R. Double 
the resistance R and only 1/2 of the current gets through, replace it with one 10 times larger and only 1/10 as much manages to flow. It is a bit like water flowing in a pipe--if you make the pipe 10 times 
narrower, then (other things being equal) only 1/10 as much water flows through.,
    Well, in case you thought that Ohm's law was a universal law of electricity--think again, because it isn't. Metal wires satisfy it fairly well, although their resistivity varies with temperature: a 
cold lightbulb filament has only 1/5 the resistance of a hot one, so that initially the lamp draws a 5-fold current, which helps switch it on quickly.  But plasmas do not satisfy it at all. The resistance 
of your fluorescent lamp is not fixed, it depends on the current carried: the greater the current, the smaller the resistance.,
      Why then a coil and not a resistor? Because the tube is fed by an alternating voltage, which rises and falls 120 times a second (in the USA; 100 times in Europe). Its electrical current sloshes back 
and forth, 60 times a second in one direction, 60 times in the opposite one. In between, 120 times each second, the voltage drops to zero and the tube is extinguished, since plasmas react very quickly. 
 Somehow, it must be relit!,
      A ballast coil can do that. In an alternating current, it acts a bit like a resistance. As the current rises, it absorbs energy from it to build up its magnetic field, slowing down its growth. Then, 
when the voltage drops to zero, the stored magnetic energy produces a voltage surge which relights the tube. You will not usually see the fast flickering of the light, except maybe if you illuminate a 
rotating fan, when (at the right speed) its motion seems to stop. (Note: compact fluorescent lamps now exist in which the ballast coil is replaced by a more complex electronic circuit. The flow of electric 
current is then limited by transistors.),
      And what about this \fluorescent\ thing? The mercury atoms in the plasma generate light very efficiently, but much of it is ultra-violet (UV), invisible to the eye and harmful to it (or rather, it 
would be, were it not absorbed by the glass). The solution is to coat the inside of the tube with a glow-in-the-dark (fluorescent) paint, which absorbs the UV and re-emits its energy as visible light.,

      All other plasma lamps--sodium and mercury streetlights, neon lights etc.--require ballast coils, too. Recently, small fluorescent lamps have appeared on the market, which screw into the socket of 
a regular lighbulb. They have transistor circuits replacing the coil, and although they cost more than filament lamps, they are (like other fluorescent lamps) much more eficient.,
    A low-intensity hum is probably no cause for alarm, although it can be annoying. But if the hum gets really loud, it my be safer to replace the coil or the fixture. Electric transformers are also constructed 
around stacked iron plates and are subject to the same problem.,
    The particles inside the Tevatron at Fermilab in Illinois need a diameter of about a mile, and a much bigger machine, the SSC or \Superconducting Super-Collider\, was started in Texas but left unfinished 
when its funds were cut off. Giant accelerators of this form, in tunnels deep underground, also exists in the European CERN facility near Geneva, where they stretch across the French-Swiss border.  ,
    The Fermilab magnet is shaped like a huge ring whose cross-section resembles the letter \c\. Inside the \c\, where the magnetic field is strong, is the pipe in which protons (and antiprotons) are accelerated 
(the \c\ cradles it the way the rim of a bicycle wheel cradles the inner tube).  That pipe also forms a ring about a mile across, with a vacuum on the inside. The magnet is really an electromagnet, and 
as the accelerated protons gain speed and energy, its electric current is gradually increased, strengthening the magnetic field in a way that keeps the orbits of the protons within the pipe.,
    Atoms consisted of negative light electrons and heavier positive nuclei, and their electric attraction fell with distance at the same rate as gravity, suggesting that electrons orbited in ellipses 
the way planets orbited the Sun. However, an additional effect was predicted: electro-magnetic processes would also make the electrons constantly lose energy by \broadcasting\ it into space, like a miniature 
radio stations. Apparently, certain orbits were immune to such losses, and light was only emitted when an electron jumped from one to the other.  ,
     At this point Albert Einstein called attention to the pendulum whose string was gradually shortened: its \adiabatic invariant\, the product E times T, was almost constant.  Could it be, he suggested, 
that any quantity that was adiabatically conserved in large-scale nature, was exactly conserved on the atomic scale? ,
    That led to the early quantum theory of Sommerfeld, for hydrogen and hydrogen-like atoms. However, when Max Born tried it on helium (two electrons) his results disagreed with observed colors of helium 
light.   The successful \wave mechanics\ theory of Schroedinger, Heisenberg and Born, which in 1925-6 replaced Bohr's naive (and unexplained) principle, used a completely different approach.,
    He apparently did not realize that this was an adiabatic invariant of the sort defined by Ehrenfest: this was pointed out at about the same time by the Russian physicists Lev Landau (Nobel, 1962) and 
Solomon Lifshitz, as a worked-out example for the student in their textbook on the theory of fields.,
    A \second\ adiabatic invariant, also important in the theory of radiation trapped in the Earth's field,  was derived by Grad, Longmire and Rosenbluth while studying the confinement of laboratory plasma, 
and a related hird\ invariant was introduced shortly afterwards by Northrop and Teller.,
  Faraday's disk dynamo  Faraday showed that another way of inducing the current was to move the electric conductor while the magnetic source stood still. This was the principle behind his disk dynamo, 
which featured a conducting disk spinning in a magnetic field--you may imagine it to be spun up by some belt and pulley, not drawn here. The electric circuit was then completed by stationary wires touching 
the disk on its rim and on its axle, shown on the right side of the drawing. This is not a very practical dynamo design (unless one seeks to generate huge currents at very low voltages), but in the large-scale 
universe, most currents are apparently produced by motions of this sort.,
 Faraday even speculated (incorrectly) that the flow of the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean was somehow electrically linked to the high atmosphere, powering there an electric discharge which (in his 
view) was the polar aurora (\Northern Lights\).,
   Faraday's disk dynamo needs a magnetic field in order to produce an electric current. Is it possible for the current which it generated to also produce the magnetic field which the dynamo process required? 
 That, in a nutshell, was what Larmor proposed was happening in sunspots.,
   At first sight this looks like a \chicken and egg\ propostion: to produce a chicken, you need an egg, but to produce an egg you need a chicken--so which of these came first? Similarly here--to produce 
a current, you need a magnetic field, but to produce a magnetic field you need a current. Where does one begin? Actually, weak magnetic fields are always present and would be gradually amplified by the 
process, so this poses no obstacle. ,
   One could, for instance, link two Faraday dynamos, each supplying the current needed to produce the other's magnetic field. They could (in principle) form a feasible self-excited dynamo, deriving its 
energy from whatever force was turning the disks. However, whether a fluid dynamo could mimic this behavior--e.g. swirls of fluid flow in a tank of liquid mercury--is a much harder question and took decades 
to resolve.,
     This limited extent suggested that the currents which disturbed the field flowedsomewhere nearby, probably near the auroral arcs.  The Norwegian Kristian Birkeland, who carefully observed auroral 
disturbances around the turn of thecentury, concluded that those currents flowed parallel to the ground, along the auroral formation. ,
      Any electric current, however, must flow in a closedcircuit, and since it seemed to be caused (like that of the aurora) by processes taking place in distant space, Birkeland proposed that it came 
down from space at one end of the arc and returned to space at the other end.  The drawing here illustrates the idea and was taken from Birkeland's 1903 report on hisexpeditions to the auroral zone:,
    When a bright aurora is seen in the auroral zone, a strong magnetic disturbance is usually also observed there.  The disturbing magnetic field can be much stronger than that of a magnetic storm but 
it is strictly local, fading away quickly as one moves equatorward.,
    In all those cases, some electrically conducting fluid appears to be movingthrough a magnetic field--plasma in space and on the Sun, molten iron (probably)in the Earth's core.  It can then be shown 
from the principles of physics that if a closed electric circuit exists, parts of which are moving through a magnetic field while  other parts are not,  an electric current will arise (additional conditions 
mustalso be satisfied).  The electric energy needed to drive the current is taken from the motion, which is slowed down.,
      Long ago, a machine that generated electricity was named \dynamo\ (today's preferred term is \generator\).  In analogy, a set-up where a conducting fluid flows through a magnetic field  and creates 
an electric current in the above fashion, is called a \fluid dynamo,\ or when a fluid process is clearly implied, simply \dynamo\.,
      The idea was sound, but the current was too weak to be measured by him.Faraday nevertheless speculated that the aurora (which he believed to be anelectric phenomenon) might be powered in a similar 
way by the Gulf Streamflowing to the north-east through the Atlantic Ocean, beginning just offshorefrom the US.  Of course, what Faraday forgot here was that to connect the ocean to the aurora, the current 
would have to cross the lower atmosphere, which is an excellent insulator and would block its flow.,
      An interesting dynamo of this type exists between the planet Jupiter and itsinnermost big moon Io (click for details). The space shuttle can also generate electric power that way (at the expense 
of itsorbital energy), using a long wire dangling from it into space. Such a space tether experiment  was conducted aboard the space shuttle Columbia on 25 February, 1996, ending unexpectedly when the 
tether suddenly broke.,
        Sir Joseph Larmor in England first proposed in 1919 that dynamos consistingentirely of fluids might explain the creation of sunspot magnetic fields. His idea was that as solar plasma flowed through 
magnetic fields, dynamo effects produced the very same currents which also created those magnetic fields. Because this is a process which \lifts itself by its own bootstraps\ (the magnetic fields needed 
by the dynamo are produced by the electric currents which are its output), it must build up gradually, starting from some \seed\ magnetic field of a different source.,
      Such a \dynamo mechanism\ was also believed to be the source of the magneticfield arising inside the Earth's molten core.  It is impossible to observe thatregion directly, but in 1964 Stanislaw Braginsky, 
in Russia, mathematicallydemonstrated a possible class of such \dynamos.\  The slow decade-by-decadevariation of the Earth's field probably comes from slow changes in the flowpatterns of the core - not, 
as Halley once proposed, from magnetized spherical layers, one inside the other, all rotating differently.,
     If the bundle of open lines maps to the region inside the auroral oval, it canbe shown that the \dynamo currents\ from the above process flow earthward  on the morning side of the magnetic pole and 
spaceward on the evening side.  One might guess that the circuit would be completed by connecting the two flows across the polar ionosphere, from the morning side, to the evening side (drawing below; the 
situation is more complicated, however, because the flow also deforms the field lines).,
    But that wasn't all.  Equatorward of each current sheet, Triad noted aparallel sheet almost as intense, flowing in the opposite direction: those field lines were no longer open, but closed inside the 
magnetosphere.  It thus seemed that most of the electric current coming down from space (about 80%) did not choose to close through the ionosphere across the magnetic poles.  Rather, it found an alternate 
way: it flowed in the ionosphere a few hundred miles equatorward and then headed out again to space, where the currents (presumably) found an easier path.,
      A 1976 study by Takesi Iijima and Tom Potemra used Triad data to map theaverage \footprints\ of these sheets in the polar ionosphere, including theirintricate overlap at midnight.,
   Their result is plotted below: the map is centered at the northern magnetic pole (though southern data were combined to produce this graph), midnight is at the bottom, and noon (where some minor additional 
currents exist) is at the top.  Dark shading indicates currents flowing towards Earth, light shading, currents flowing outward into space.,
 When such processes occur in air, they produce there free ions and electrons, which can move and carry an electric current, something neutral atoms cannot do. Air is usually an excellent electrical insulator, 
but with ionization present, electric charges can leak through it.,
 When the plate at the end of the rod is electrically charged (e.g. by rubbing it with a dry cloth), the leaves spread wide apart, since both carry electric charges of the same sign and repel each other. 
 However, when a radioactive substance is brought close, the electric charge leaks to the box and the leaves gradually drop down again.,
 The next heavier atom is that of helium (chemical symbol He) and it contains two electrons.  Its nucleus consists of two protons and also two neutrons, particles similar to the proton but with no electric 
charge.  The Sun gets its energy by combining  protons (some of which convert to neutrons in the process) into helium, deep in the Sun's core;  since the helium nucleus is an unusually stable combination 
of particles, energy is released in the process.,
 The completely ionized helium atom He++, missing both electrons, is also known as the \alpha particle\ (see history section). Just as in the Sun and in most stars, hydrogen is the most abundant element 
with helium next, so the solar wind consist mostly of protons, with 5% alpha particles and small numbers of heavier ions.,
 A somewhat similar composition exists among cosmic rays, a very thin drizzle of ions moving close to the speed of light and bombarding the Earth from all directions; they probably fill our galaxy and 
their origin is uncertain.,
 It may be mentioned that in addition to such atomic ions, there also exist molecular ions of either sign, formed when intact molecules lose or gain an electron.  Such ions occur in ionospheric processes.,

 In practice the barium is packed into canisters with copper oxide, and these are released from rockets or satellites and ignited.  The resulting chemical reaction produces great heat, but more barium 
is packed into the canister than can combine chemically, and some the excess is vaporized to form a large spherical greenish cloud.Typically the release is done after sunset or before sunrise, so that 
while the canisters explode in full sunlight, observers on the ground can watch the cloud against the dark sky: soon a bluish ion cloud separates from the green one, usually elongated or striped in the 
direction of the magnetic field lines, which guide the ions.,
 Some barium releases are conducted far from Earth and are tracked by telescopes.  The AMPTE mission (Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Experiment), launched in 1984, released barium clouds near the 
ose\ of the magnetosphere and in the magnetospheric tail.,
 In addition it released a barium cloud in the solar wind to produce an \artificial comet\. Soon after the cloud formed, the magnetic field embedded in the solar wind picked it and made it share the wind's 
flow, a process similar to the one which creates the ion tails of comets (see solar wind, history).,
   Starting in 1942, Geiger counters and other detectors, set up to monitorcosmic rays, have occasionally seen sudden increases in the intensity of theradiation, associated with outbursts on the Sun, mostly 
with visible flares. Thecosmic ray intensity returns to normal within minutes or hours, as theacceleration process ends and as accelerated ions disperse throughoutinterplanetary space.,
   On the scale of cosmic radiation, solar-produced ions have relatively lowenergies, generally below 1 Gev (=billion electron volts) and rarely above 10 Gev. That is why such events are often missed by 
cosmic ray detectors near the equator, where the lowest energies are excluded by the Earth's magnetic field. The best detectors for observing solar particles are therefore those sensitive to the lowest 
energies of the cosmic radiation.  ,
   In many events the Sun emits enormous numbers of lower-energy ions, with no more than tens of Mev (=millions electron volts).  The Earth's magnetic field diverts them to the vicinity of the magnetic 
poles, where they may temporarily smother the ionosphere and interfere with radio communications. Such \polar cap blackouts\ used to bother US military radar installations which scanned the polar cap for 
hostile missiles.,
   While searching for an explanation of particle acceleration on the Sun,British researchers in the 1950s, in particular Peter Sweet and James Dungey,proposed the idea of magnetic reconnection, an idea 
later applied to the Earth'smagnetosphere and to substorms. Reconnection is still believed to be the energy source of flares and CMEs, but unfortunately, it seems to happen in the lower corona, where magnetic 
structures are invisible (with a few exceptions--see picture below).  The nature of substorms and solar acceleration events may indeed be similar, though their scales differ greatly.  However, satellites 
can be sent to substorms but not to the Sun, and therefore magnetospheric research may well hold clues to some of the problems of solar physics.,
      Electric forces in nature come in two kinds. First, there is the electric attraction or repulsion between (+) and (-) electric charges.  It is possible to use this to define a unit of electric charge, 
as the charge which repels a similar charge at a distance of, say, 1 meter, with a force of unit strength (actual formulas make this precise).,
      But second, there is also the attraction and repulsion between parallel electric currents. One could then define the unit of current, as the current which, when flowing in a straight wire, attracts 
a similar current in a parallel wire 1 meter away with a force of unit strength, for every meter of the wires' length.,
      But electric current and charge are related!  We could have just as well based the unit of current on the unit of charge--say, as the current in which one unit of charge passes each second through 
any cross section of the wire. This second definition turns out to be quite different, and if meters and seconds are used in all definitions, the ratio of the two units of current turns out to be the speed 
of light, 300,000,000 meters per second.,
      Remember the idea of Faraday which evolved into the \magnetic field\ concept--that space in which magnetic forces may be observed is somehow changed? Faraday also showed that a magnetic field which 
varied in time--like the one produced by an alternating current (AC)--could drive electric currents, if (say) copper wires were placed in it in the appropriate way. That was \magnetic induction,\ the phenomenon 
on which electric transformers are based. ,
      So, magnetic fields could produce electric currents, and we already know that  electric currents produce magnetic fields. Would it perhaps be possible for space to support a wave motion alternating 
between the two? Sort of: ,
      With that term added (the \displacement current\), the equations of electricity and magnetism allowed a wave to exist, propagating at the speed of light. The drawing below illustrates such a wave--green 
is the magnetic part, blue the electric part--the term Maxwell added. The wave is drawn propagating just along one line. Actually it fills space, but it would be hard to draw that.,
       Maxwell proposed that it indeed was light. There had been earlier hints--as noted above, the velocity of light had appeared unexpectedly in the equations of electricity and magnetism--and further 
studies confirmed it. For instance, if a beam of light hits the side of a glass prism, only part of it enters--another part gets reflected. Maxwell's theory correctly predicted properties of the reflected 
beam.,
      Then Heinrich Hertz in Germany showed that an electric current bouncing back and forth in a wire (nowadays it would be called an \antenna\) could be the source of such waves. (The current also produces 
a magnetic field in accordance with Ampere's law, but that field decreases  rapidly with distance.) Electric sparks create such back-and-forth currents when they jump across a gap--hence the crackling 
caused by lightning on AM radio--and Hertz in 1886 used such sparks to send a radio signal across his lab. Later the Italian Marconi, with more sensitive detectors, extended the range of radio reception, 
and in 1903 detected signals from Europe as far as Cape Cod, Massachussets.,
      It was presumed that light from the hot wire of a lightbulb was emitted because the heat caused electrons to bounce back and forth rapidly, turning each into a tiny antenna.  When physicists tried 
to follow that idea, however, they found that the familiar laws of nature had to be modified on the scale of atomic sizes. That was how quantum theory originated.,
      Gradually other electromagnetic waves were found  The wave nature of light causes different colors to be reflected differently by a surface ruled in fine parallel scratches--which is why a compact 
laser disk (for music or computer use) shimmers in all colors of the rainbow. The orderly rows of atoms in a crystal also form parallel lines but spaced much more closely, and they turned out to have the 
same effect on X-rays, showing that X-rays, like light, also were electromagnetic waves, but of a much shorter wavelength. Later it was found that beams of electrons in a magnetic field, inside a vacuum 
tube, could become unstable and emit waves longer than light: the magnetron tube where this occured was a top-secret radar device in World War II, and it later made the microwave oven possible.,
      Electromagnetic waves led to radio and television, and to a huge electronic industry. But they are also generated in space--by unstable electron beams in the magnetosphere, as well as at the Sun 
and in the far-away universe, telling us about energetic particles in distant space, or else teasing us with unresolved mysteries.  You can find more about this in the section on high energy particles.,

    The answer was given in 1884 by Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927), a many-talented Swede who received the 1903 Nobel prize for chemistry and who (among his many achievements) first suggested the  \greenhouse 
effect.\  Arrhenius proposed that when a compound like table salt NaCl (sodium chloride) was dissolved in water, it broke up into electrically charged \ions\ (Greek for he ones that move\) Na+ and Cl-. 
 Electric forces made Na+ ions move in one direction, Cl- ions in the opposite one, and that was how the electric current was carried.,
    Although at first this seemed like a strange idea, today it is quite well understood.  Many chemical molecules are formed when atoms share electrons, but molecules such as those of NaCl are different. 
 There, the sodium atom (Na) gives up an electron to the chlorine (Cl), creating ions Na+ and Cl-, which in solid salt are held together by their electric attraction (\ionic bond\).  Water, however, greatly 
weakens that attraction (on a microscopic scale), allowing the ions to drift free whenever salt is dissolved in water, and allowing the water to conduct electricity.,
    Today, of course, proton beams are routinely produced and accelerated to very high energies, in huge machines like the \Tevatron\ south of Chicago and the accelerators of CERN (Europe's center for 
nuclear research) near Geneva. Some of them are allowed to smash into targets, to study the structure of matter and produce a variety of ew\ particles.  Another \cleaner\ mode of studying them is to cause 
a head-on collision between a beam of protons and another one of antiprotons, \antimatter\ particles resembling protons but with a negative charge. The proton-antiproton collision is cleaner because it 
only involves two relatively simple particles, but the antiprotons must first be produced by some other high-energy collisions, since they do not usually exist in nature.,
     Ultimately beta rays were identified as electrons and \alpha particles\ as completely ionized helium nuclei; a third component, \gamma rays\ unaffected by magnets, turned out to be related to light 
and X-rays.  For his work on radioactivity, Rutherford was awarded a Nobel prize in 1908.,
 These two bundles, known as the ail lobes\, extend far from Earth: ISEE-3 and Geotail found them well-defined even at 200-220 RE (Earth radii) from Earth.  At those distances the lobes are already penetrated 
by some solar wind plasma, but near Earth they are almost empty.  One may compare typical plasma densities:,
    We have already met two systems of electric currents in the magnetosphere--the ring current carried by trapped plasma, and the magnetopause current confining the magnetosphere to the inside of a cavity 
in the solar wind, a current that flows on the surface of that cavity.  A third system is the cross-tail current flowing across the plasma sheet from dawn to dusk (drawing below).,
    It is easy to see that the tail must contain additional currents, for the stretching-out of the tail lobes amounts to adding a magnetic field to the magnetosphere.  Any magnetic field in space requires 
some electric current to produce it, and the cross-tail current can be viewed as the source of the tail lobes.  Like every steady electric current, it too must flow in a closed circuit, and the closing 
occurs in two branches that follow the magnetopause around either tail.,
    The diffuse aurora was discovered by the Canadian spacecraft ISIS 2 in 1972, and it expands and contracts as the tail lobes swell and shrink due to variations in the solar wind and its magnetic field. 
 It was extensively observed by (among others) the US Dynamics Explorer mission (1981-7), more recently by the Swedish satellites Viking (1986) and Freja (1992), and currently by the ISTP observatory on 
\Polar\ .,
    James Dungey's theory of reconnection suggested an answer of sorts.  Recall (section on the  magnetopause) that in an ideal plasma, ions and electrons that share a field line move together and continue 
sharing it at all times (\like beads on a wire\).  Dungey pointed out an exception to this rule, that when the plasma flowed through a eutral point\ or eutral line\ at which the magnetic force was zero, 
the plasmas on both sides of that point could become separated and could \reconnect\ to different field lines.,
    Dungey suggested that such a neutral point existed near the front of the magnetopause (marked N on the drawing).  He proposed that interplanetary field lines (with the plasma riding on them) linked 
up there with terrestrial ones, forming compound lines like the one to the right of \3\ in the drawing. ,
    That line contains a sharp bend:  most of the plasma on the section beyond the bend is interplanetary, most of it on the section closer to Earth is terrestrial. However, both plasmas move together, 
continue to share the same line, and slowly intermix.,
    A while later, that line would have moved to position of the line right of \4\, then to the position \5\, and after that, perhaps half an hour later, the reconnection process would be reversed somewhere 
downstream of Earth, at a neutral point or line near the number \6\.  The interplanetary parts are then rejoined and flow away, and the terrestrial halves are reunited too.,
 Neglecting spill-over at boundary points like the sharp bend in line \3\ (and glossing over some important, and as yet not completely understood, plasma physics), one realizes that the above process will 
transport near-noon plasma, originally earthward of the bend on line \3\, to the distant tail. Dungey proposed that the plasma then flowed back earthward, through the plasma sheet. ,
    This would create a steady circulation of plasma in the magnetosphere and would also bring fresh ions and electrons into the plasma sheet, from the vicinity of \6\.  The process is often named \convection\, 
a name used for circulating flows produced by heat, for instance the flow of water in a heated pot (drawing).,
    If all particles on a field line move together, as tail plasma convects back earthward, the particles on the same field lines but just above the atmosphere  must keep up with it.  Flows of plasma in 
that region, consistent with Dungey's prediction, have indeed been observed by probing antennas and by \driftmeter\ instruments aboard near-Earth satellites, in orbits that cross the polar regions at low 
altitudes.  The electric field associated with them has also been measured, and for that reason most scientists now support the notion of circulating plasma.,
    However, in the tail itself the earthward flow has been harder to confirm and seems to be rather irregular, coming in fits and bursts, especially during magnetic substorms.  The distant neutral point 
near \6\ is hard to pinpoint using only isolated satellites, and other plasma processes may also play a help break the temporary links between terrestrial field lines  (with their plasma) and interplanetary 
space. \Geotail\ observations suggest that this separation occurs about 70-100 RE away on the night side,
      But there also exists a practical angle: in a world increasingly dependent on electricity and electronics, the \space weather\ outside the atmosphere can have serious effects, in particular on human 
communications.,
      Currently more than 200 communication satellites circle the Earth in synchronous orbit.  A large magnetic storm can greatly increase the number of fast ions and electrons which hit those satellites; 
such ions and electrons are similar to the ones emitted by radioactive substances and can create serious problems.,
      The simplest effect is an electric charge on the satellite, usually negative, raising its voltage to hundreds or even thousands of volts.   Charging by itself has little effect on the satellite's 
operation, although on a scientific satellite it would seriously distort observations (if the satellite is charged to, say, -500 volts, electrons with less energy than 500 electron-volts are repelled and 
cannot be detected). However, if different parts of the satellite are charged to different voltages, the current between them can cause damage.,
    Particles with higher energy can permanently degrade solar cells.  Also, high-energy particles can penetrate the circuitry and cause either damage or false signals which lead to unintended responses 
by the satellite. All these have occured in the past.,
       This disturbance also induces extra currents in the wires of the electrical power grid, creating a temporary overload.  Serious overloads of this type can trigger circuit breakers and thus cause 
widespread \power blackouts,\ and on occasion they have even destroyed power transformers.,
      For these reasons, conditions at the Sun, in interplanetary space and in the magnetosphere are closely watched. The  Space Environment Center in Boulder, Colorado, maintained by of the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has a  Space Weather Operation facility which constantly tracks the \weather\ in space.,
      This is done in several ways. NOAA satellites of the GOES series, in synchronous orbit,  observe the local radiation environment and also monitor the Sun's x-rays, which come from the corona and 
increase at active times. Telescopes on Earth observe the Sun through special filters and in special wavelength (e.g. x-rays), all of which highlight active features.  For a view of NOAA's \space weather 
report,\ click here; another such report, from the University of Michigan, is linked here.,
      In an interesting development, the recent SOHO spacecraft, currently at the L1 Lagrangian point, allows scientists to detect (by special processing of its images) coronal mass ejections, not just 
in a sideways view but even when they are headed straight for Earth. A CME noted in this way on January 6, 1997, arrived as predicted on the 10th-11th and caused a widespread disturbance. Another such 
event occured   April 7-11, 1997.,
      Of course, the sideways view of CMEs contains additional information, and NASA's planned solar missions include STEREO (Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory), with a pair of well-separated solar 
observatories, to get a stereoscopic view of such eruptions.  One spacecraft would orbit near Earth, the other would be stationed elsewhere in the Earth's orbit around the Sun, capturing a sideways view 
of solar eruptions.  So far there is unfortunately no sure way of predicting whether the direction of the magnetic field carried by an erupting solar plasma would slant northwards or southwards, an important 
factor in predicting \space weather.\ Closer to Earth, spacecraft near the L1 point such as SOHO and WIND, and since August 1997 also ACE, intercept shocks  and plasma clouds up to one hour before their 
arrival at Earth and serve as early warning stations.,
      An obvious question is whether the high energy particles produced by such events constitute a hazard not just for spacecraft but also for astronauts. So far no astronauts have been seriously exposed, 
not even those on the Russian space station \Mir\ whose inclined orbit extends to fairly high latitudes, closer to the auroral zone than the planned orbit of the International Space Station planned by 
NASA. Nothing in space can be guaranteed, however, and re-entry modules for quick escape into the protecting atmosphere have been studied.,
 An article about the violent consequences of the arrival at Earth of an interplanetary shock wave from the Sun, on 24 March 1991, titled \The Birth of a Radiation Belt\ (part of this site).,
      On typical field lines, attached to the Earth at both ends, such motion wouldsoon lead the particles into the atmosphere, where they would collide and losetheir energy.  However, an additional feature 
of trapped motion usually preventsthis from happening: the sliding motion slows down as the particle moves intoregions where the magnetic field is strong, and it may even stop and reverse.It is as if the 
particles were repelled from such regions, an interestingcontrast with iron, which is attracted to where the magnetic field is strong.,
      The magnetic force is much stronger near the Earth than far away, and onany field line it is greatest at the ends, where the line enters the atmosphere.Thus electrons and ions can remain trapped 
for a long time, bouncing back and forth from one hemisphere to the other (see picture above, not to scale--the actual spiral gets much smaller near Earth).  In this way the Earth holds on to itsradiation 
belts.,
      In addition to spiraling and bouncing, the trapped particles also slowly driftfrom one field line to another one like it, gradually going all the way aroundEarth.  Ions drift one way (clockwise, 
viewed from north), electrons the other,and in either drift, the motion of electric charges is equivalent to an electric current circling the Earth clockwise.  ,
      That is the so-called ring current, whose magnetic field slightly weakens thefield observed over most of the Earth's surface. During magnetic storms the ringcurrent receives many additional ions 
and electrons from the nightside ail\ ofthe magnetosphere and its effect increases, though at the Earth's surface it is always very small, onlyrarely exceeding 1% of the total magnetic field intensity.,

      The years 1957-8 were designated as the \International Geophysical Year\(IGY), and both the USA and the Soviet Union (Russia) prepared to launch at thattime artificial satellites, the first ever. 
 Russia successfully orbited itsfirst Sputnik (\satellite\) on October 4, 1957, but the official US entry,Vanguard, failed at launch.  The US then quickly assembled an alternative rocketcarrying a different 
satellite, the small Explorer 1 built by James Van Allenand his team at the University of Iowa.  It was launched on 31 January, 1958.,
      Explorer 1 carried only one instrument, a small detector of energeticparticles, a Geiger counter designed to observe cosmic rays (ions of very highenergy and unknown origin, arriving at Earth from 
distant space--seelater section).  The experiment worked quite well at low altitudes, but at thetop of the orbit no particles at all were counted.  Explorer 3, which followedtwo months later, collected 
on tape a continuous record of data, which revealedthat the zero counts actually represented a very high level of radiation.  Somany energetic particles hit the counter at the higher altitudes, that its 
modeof operation was overwhelmed and it fell silent.  Not only was a radiation beltpresent at all times, it was remarkably intense.,
      Further out is the large region of the ring current, containing ions andelectrons of much lower energy (the most energetic among them also known as the\outer radiation belt\). Unlike the inner belt, 
this population fluctuates widely, rising when magnetic storms inject fresh particles from the tail of the magnetosphere, then gradually falling off again.  The ring current energy is mainly carried by 
the ions, most of which are protons.,
      However, one also sees in the ring current \alpha particles,\ atoms of heliumwhich have lost their two electrons, a type of ion that is plentiful in thesolar wind.In addition, a certain percentage 
are O+ oxygen ions, similar to those inthe ionosphere of the Earth, though much more energetic.  This mixture of ionssuggests that ring current particles probably come from more than one source.,
      Space phenomena involve energy on two very different scales.  One scaleinvolves the energy of individual ions and electrons, which often move at arespectable fraction of the velocity of light (an 
upper limit which they cannever reach).  The faster the particle moves, the higher its energy and thegreater is the thickness of material needed to stop it.  Energies like these aremeasured in electron 
volts (eV): auroral electrons have 1000-15,000 eV, protonsin the inner belt perhaps 50 million eV, while the energy of cosmic ray ions mayreach many billions.  In contrast, air molecules in the atmosphere 
only haveabout 0.03 eV, raising what could be the most fundamental question in spaceresearch--how come a few particles get so much?,
      The other scale is that of global space phenomena:  magnetic storms,substorms, auroral displays and electric currents linking Earth and space.  Whofoots their energy bill?  The main source of energy 
seems to be the solar wind,but the pathways by which this energy is transported and distributed in themagnetosphere are not yet completely clear.,
      The orbital speed of any satellite depends on its distance from Earth.  In acircular orbit just outside the dense atmosphere, a satellite needs only 90minutes for one full circuit, but more distant 
satellites move more slowly, andat a radius of 6.6 RE the period is close to 24 hours, matching the rotationperiod of the Earth.  A satellite at this distance, above the equator, alwaysstays above the 
same spot on Earth, and when viewed from Earth (say, by a TVdish antenna) it is always in the same direction in the sky.  ,
      This makes the synchronous orbit the perfect place for satellites devoted tocommunications and to broadcasting, and it is also used for world-wide weathermonitoring, e.g. by the GOES series of satellites 
of NOAA (National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration).  The synchronous orbit is also useful forscientific work, because on the nightside of the Earth it lies quite close tothe transition from the ring 
current to the magnetospheric ail\.,
    Electrons and ions, of the energies commonly encountered in the magnetosphere, tend to circle around magnetic field lines.  Like the motion of planets around the Sun, this motion too can sustain itself 
with no energy input, and can therefore (in principle) persist for a long time.,
    As such particles circle their guiding field line, the \guiding center\ of their rotation generally slides up or down that line, creating a typical spiral pattern.  However, a subtle interaction causes 
the spiraling particle to be repelled from regions of stronger magnetic field, where field lines converge.,
    Without this sort of \mirroring,\ ions and electrons would not be trapped in the Earth's magnetosphere, but would instead follow their guiding field lines into the atmosphere, where they would be absorbed 
and become lost.  What usually happens instead, is that every time a trapped particle approaches Earth, it is reflected back. It is thus confined to the more distant section of the field line.,
    In addition to the rapid rotation (\gyration\) around field lines and the back-and-forth \bounce\ motion, trapped particles also undergo a slow \drift\, by which they jump from one field line onto 
another one nearby, similar to the original one but slightly rotated around the Earth's magnetic axis.  Viewed from the north pole, a positive ion will gradually rotate clockwise, a negative electron counter-clockwise.,

    Because positive ions and negative electrons drift in opposite directions (see drawing), that motion will create an electric current that circulates clockwise around the Earth when viewed from north. 
 The current is aptly named the ring current.,
    Note how different electric currents in space are from those encountered in everyday life!  Currents we use at home--for light, to drive machinery or to generate heat--only flow if pushed by an electric 
pressure or voltage, against the resistance of the circuitry.  The flow of such currents is in many ways similar to the flow of water through a pipe--water, too, will only flow if pressure is available, 
to help it overcome the friction inside the pipe.  The flow of both water and electricity require a constant input of energy: once we click the switch and disconnect a house current from its source of 
voltage, it stops practically instantly.,
    The flow of the ring current, and of many other currents in space, is quite different.  It needs neither a driving voltage nor an energy input, but persists as long as its ions and electrons are trapped 
in the magnetic field.  Many aspects of such \collision-free plasmas\ are quite unlike what one might expect, and are often hard to reproduce in the laboratory: that is why the magnetosphere is probably 
our best atural laboratory\ for studying the processes of distant space.,
    The magnetic field produced by the ring current contributes (rather slightly) to the magnetic field observed at the surface of the Earth.  There are however times when the population of trapped particles 
is greatly reinforced.  The ring current then becomes stronger and its magnetic effect at Earth may grow 10-fold or more: that is known as a magnetic storm.  The reinforcing particles are generally of 
moderate energy, but can be quite numerous. As discussed in a later section such events can interfere with the operation of communication satellites and cause other problems.,
    If trapped orbits are so stable that their particles cannot be easily lost, those particles should not be able to easily enter them, either.  How then can the radiation belt and ring current arise?,

    The ring current however (its energetic part is often called the \outer radiation belt\), owes its existence to magnetic storms, which can replenish it in the matter of hours. The process by which 
that happens is still incompletely understood, but it involves electric forces, combining with magnetic ones.  Electric fields are able to push trapped particles earthward, and unlike the purely magnetic 
motion described earlier, an electric field can also energize them.,
    The ultimate source of the energy and electric field must be the solar wind, and theories exist to explain how they are transmitted.  Some are mentioned in further sections, but many details are still 
unclear and controversial.,
    The best we can do is station-keeping: for instance, the motion of a satellite in a synchronous orbit around the equator is matched by the rotation of the Earth below it, allowing it to permanently 
stay above the same equatorial spot.,
    However, orbital laws require planets closer to the Sun to move faster, by a formula found in 1619 by Johannes Kepler.  While the Earth goes around the Sun in 365 days, Venus which is closer only needs 
225 days and Mercury, closer still, only 88.  Thus any spacecraft going around the Sun in an orbit smaller than the Earth's will soon overtake it and move away, and will not keep a fixed station relative 
to Earth.,
    If the distance is just right--about 4 times the distance to the Moon or 1/100 the distance to the Sun--the spacecraft, too, will need just one year to go around the Sun, and will keep its position 
between the Sun and the Earth.  That position is the Lagrangian Point L1, so called after the Italian-French mathematician who pointed it out, Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813).,
    The sister-site From Stargazers to Starships discusses Lagrangian points in more detail than is done here, among other things deriving the distance of L1 (the derivation of L2 is almost identical) 
and also the equilibrium points L4 and L5. While neither calculation requires calculus, both are somewhat lengthy and assume familiarity with basic principles of Newtonian mechanics, covered in preceding 
sections of the \Stargazers\ site.,
    Such a spacecraft must have its own rocket engine.  First, the position is unstable: if the spacecraft slips off it, it will slowly drift away, and sooner or later some correcting action is needed. 
In fact, the preferred position is actually some distance to the side of L1, for if the spacecraft is right on the Sun-Earth line, the antennas which track it from Earth are also aimed at the Sun, a source 
of interfering radio waves.  Thus corrections are in fact needed quite regularly.  Furthermore, the most economic way of getting to L1 is letting the spacecraft pass close to the Moon and using the moon's 
gravity to extract an extra boost from the Moon's orbital motion.  Those maneuvers too require on-board propulsion, as does the final approach to L1.,
    There exist altogether 5 Lagrangian points in the Sun-Earth system and such points also exist in the Earth-Moon system.  Among these, the most attention has been given to the two stable points L4 and 
L5, located in the Moon's orbit but off the position of the Moon (see picture).  These positions have been studied as possible sites for artificial space colonies in some (very!) distant future.,
      That may be OK, because most of us are familiar with currents and charges. Currents run electric lights, radios, TVs, clocks and applicances in the home, and \static\ electric charge causes papers 
and clothes to cling together in dry weather. An electric current is essentially the continuous flow of electric charge. This section goes a little further, to the concepts of voltage and of the electric 
field. ,
      It is easier to understand electricity if we regard electric charge as a sort of fluid,  like water, as scientists did for the first 200 years. Yes, it does consist of individual electrons, but those 
are so small that any large charge behaves like a continuous fluid. In the same way sand pours like a fluid, and water in a glass is usually regarded as a fluid, even though it consists of individual molecules. 
,
      Using a pump we can push water through a pipe around a closed circuit (top drawing). The rate at which it flows past any point in the pipe--measured in  gallons (or liters)  per second--depends on 
the pressure produced by the pump (measured in pounds per square inch, or kilograms per square centimeter).  More accurately, it depends on the pressure difference between the entrance to the pipe (left) 
and the exit from the pipe (right). ,
        The greater the pressure difference, the greater the flow.  In addition, given a certain pressure difference, a fatter pipe will carry more water, and a longer one will resist the flow and carry 
less.,
      No pipes here, though: electricity in our homes and appliances usually flows in metal wires, most often of copper. Electrons in a metal can jump from atom to atom, and that way carry negative charge 
around the circuit.,
        Like a fluid, they are driven by a kind of electric pressure, known as voltage,  because it is measured in units known as volts,  named after the Italian scientist Alessandro Volta. An electric 
battery produces (by a chemical process) a voltage difference V between its two ends, and therefore acts like a pump (bottom drawing). ,
        The electric current I flows from high voltage to low voltage and is measured in units known as Amperes,  named for André-Marie Ampere whom we met in section #2. And as with water,  we expect that 
if we increase the driving voltage V, the driven current I will also increase. In fact, the two are pretty much proportional: double the voltage, and you get double the current. That relation is known 
as Ohm's Law,  after Georg Ohm who first formulated it. ,
         Ohm's law (with some extra details concerning the length and thickness of the wire) is usually among the first things taught in electricity classes, and many students therefore view it as one 
of the fundamental laws of electricity. It isn't. It holds quite well for metal wires, but as will be shown in section #7a, it fails badly in fluorescent tubes--while in space currents exist which flow 
without any voltage driving them (section #10a).,
      One small caution here. By long tradition, the direction of the electric current is defined as the direction in which positive charges move. We may blame Ben Franklin for deciding--by pure guess--what 
kind of electricity is called \positive\ and which egative.\ A century later it was found that most electric currents were carried by negative electrons, which move in the opposite direction. ,
        One may therefore argue that the flow direction which should be assigned to electric fluid is really the opposite of what we say it is. But it's much too late to change the old convention.,
      In our homes, electric currents and effects of electricity are usually channeled along insulated wires.    In 3-dimensional space, on the other hand, electric phenomena tend to spread out. If the 
way electric current flows in the home resembles water flow in pipes, then in space the  flow is often like ocean currents or air motion in the atmosphere, spread out in 2 and even 3 dimensions.  ,
        In a wire, voltage depends only on one dimension--on the distance along the wire. In space, every point can have its own voltage. Currents that flow may depend on such voltages, but don't look 
to Ohm's law for guidance, because the flow of current is primarily dictated by magnetic fields, which makes a difference.,
 In a magnetic field the direction of the field is that of the force. If isolated N magnetic poles existed, they too could do so, by moving in the direction of the field, while S poles would move in the 
opposite direction. The poles at the ends of a compass needle move this way, and thus line up the needle in the direction of the field.,
      An electric field is a region where electric forces can be felt by charged objects, and the direction of the field is the one in which positive charges would move. A positive ion moves in the direction 
of the field, a negative electron moves in the opposite direction. ,
     Because the force is perpendicular to the velocity, it can only change the direction of motion, not its speed or energy. Because no energy is needed to keep up the motion, it can (in principle) persist 
indefinitely.,
    The motion of ions on    coverging field lines.By the laws of motion, any force can always be resolved into the sum of mutually perpendicular forces, each controlling the motion in its direction.  
The \radial force\ perpendicular to the axis of the cone (drawing) keeps the ion or electron turning in a circle around that axis, and is balanced (as noted above) by the centrifugal force of that rotation.,

    In addition, however, there will also exist a small force parallel to the axis, repelling the particle away from the tip of the cone.  That added force gradually slows down the particle's advance down 
the axis and finally reverses it, causing it to \mirror\ and bounce back.,
  In the theory of motions, this is an example of a periodic motion  whose period gradually decreases.  The best-known periodic motion is the back-and-forth swing of a pendulum, say of a weight suspended 
by a string (drawing).  The shorter the string, the shorter the time of each swing (\period\), which goes like the square root of the length.  One can replace the support point with a pulley wheel, which 
is gradually lowered and its string shortened (ignore the word \pull\ which is explained further below). The bottom of the swing stays in the same height, but the period gets shorter and shorter.,
     It turns out that the product T x E, the period T times the energy E, is almost a constant.  It is not an exact constant, like total energy in a system, but if the rate of change is slow enough, e.g. 
if the string is pulled rather slowly, it comes very close.,
     The motion of electrons and ions spiraling around magnetic field lines is also periodic. While the period of a pendulum changes when its string gets longer or shorter, that of a  spiraling ion or 
electron changes as it moves into regions where the magnetic field is weaker or stronger. Just as for a pendulum the product T x E stays very nearly constant, so here too, a certain quality, an \adiabatic 
invariant,\ is almost kept at a constant value. From that constancy it is possible to deduce the \mirroring\ of particle and many other properties of their motion.,
        That is somewhat similar to the case of the lowered support, but the calculation gives a diferent rate. With the lowered support, work is also done--but that happens when the weight is pulled in 
from the sides to swing in a shorter arc, not at the bottom of the swing.,
     The process described here is related to the way children \pump\ a swing to make it go higher.  The child moves arms, legs and body in a way that works against the centrifugal force, and the energy 
invested in overcoming this force ends up producing a more energetic swinging motion.,
      (This is a highly simplified explanation and assumes that from the point of view of the child in the swing, nature behaves exactly the same as anywhere else, only a centrifugal force is added. The 
actual situation can be more complicated.),
   The \Exploratorium\ science museum in San Francisco has a small swing (too small to carry a person) that can be \pumped\ from the outside. The seat of the swing, instead of hanging by two ropes or chains, 
is attached to the axis by two smooth parallel rods.   ,
    Above the regular swing seat is a second seat, with two wide holes threaded by the two rods. Under normal circumstances, the second seat will drop to the bottom, on top of the regular one. However, 
a rope is connected to its middle, going over the bar from which the swing hangs and down again, and a person standing next to the swing can pull that string or let it go, making the second seat rise along 
the rods or fall down again.  ,
    With your hand, you set the swing moving with moderate motion. Now, by pulling the rope or letting go at suitable times in the oscillation, you can easily \pump up\ the motion. You only need to pull 
the swing up when it passes the lowest part of its motion, and let it down again at the extreme ends of its motion, when for a brief instant it is at rest.  ,
    These, though, are just averages: the pressure of the solar wind rises and falls, and as it does, the magnetopause shrinks or expands.  For instance, when the boundary is hit by a fast flow from a 
coronal mass ejection, the ose\ is pushed in, occasionally (a few times a year, usually) even past the synchronous orbit at 6.6 RE.,
 The tight bond between particles and field lines can sometimes be broken, e.g. when the particles undergo collisions or when the plasma flows through a eutral point\ where the field's intensity drops 
to zero.,
 On a plot of magnetic field lines, such points stand out as the ones where field lines appear to intersect each other. Intersecting field lines seem to make no sense:  how can the magnetic field point 
in two directions at once?  If our plots nevertheless show such points, the intensity of the magnetic force at them must be zero, so that the direction of that force is irrelevant.,
 For example, one gets such points when one plots the field line configuration inside a magnetopause which perfectly confines all of the Earth's field lines (drawing above). There will be two such points, 
known as the cusps of the magnetosphere, and they mark the separation between lines going sunward and those going tailward.,
    When spacecraft were actually sent to the cusp region--the European HEOS 1 and HEOS 2 (1968, 1972) and the University of Iowa's \Hawkeye\ (1974)--they seemed to observe a disordered magnetic field, 
weak but not zero. The absence of a strong field to hold off the solar wind means that these are \weak spots\ on the magnetopause, and solar wind plasma penetrates there to fill two funnel-shaped regions. 
 Some of the plasma particles travel all the way to the top of the atmosphere, where their collisions produce a red auroral glow.,
    A feature of simple neutral points is that the magnetic fields flanking them have opposite directions (drawing).  Field lines just inside the ose\ of the magnetopause point northward.  On the other 
hand, at times when the IMF has a southward slant, as its field lines become draped against the nose (drawing) they have a generally southward orientation.,
     This situation is idealized in the image on the right, where the neutral point in the middle is assumed to extend in the direction perpendicular to the drawing, forming a eutral line.\ Plasma flows 
in from the left and the right, and exits up and down.  The flow is identified as a \magnetic reconnection\ process because when lines \1\ and \2\ reach the neutral line, they change their structure--the 
two top halves join up and flow away, ultimately reaching the position of the line defined as \3\, while the two bottom halves join up and form the line which later becomes \4\ (more about reconnection 
in the appropriate part of \a brief history of magnetospheric physics\).,
    In 1961 James Dungey in England proposed that when this happened, a neutral point N (or a more extended eutral line\) formed somewhere near the nose, and as plasma flowed through it, field line connections 
became realigned.  Terrestrial lines like the one numbered \2\ in the drawing, and interplanetary ones like the outer one also numbered \2\, would each be \opened up\ and reconnected,  so that the ions 
strung out along each line \like beads on a string\ became divided into two groups, one group flowing north, the other flowing south.   The northward flowing group would migrate to line \3\ in the drawing, 
an \open magnetic field line\ linking Earth to interplanetary space.  A short time later the field line linking those particles will occupy position \4\, then \5\.  Dungey proposed that the process was 
reversed at some distant neutral point (or neutral line) \6\ in the far tail, as illustrated here by a figure adapted from his original article.  There the interplanetary line halves were reunited and 
flowed away, and the ends connected to Earth were also joined up again.,
    Since the nose of the magnetosphere (on the average) maintains its position and is not \worn away\ by the reconnection process, the magnetic field lines swept into the tail, and the plasma particles 
strung along them, must somehow flow back towards Earth, inside the magnetosphere.  This (according to Dungey) explained the large-scale sunward flow of the tail, deduced from auroral motions and flows 
in the polar ionsphere, on field lines which extended into the tail.,
    Dungey's process of \magnetic reconnection\ is expected to increase the flow of energy from the solar wind to the magnetosphere, by establishing a direct field-line link between the two.  It does, 
however, require a southward slant of interplanetary magnetic field lines, a condition which only exists about half the time.,
    In 1966, soon after regular observations of the IMF began, a student of Dungey, Don Fairfield, did in fact note a strong correlation between such southward slants and the storminess of the magnetic 
field (\magnetic activity\).  Nowadays \southward IMF\ is recognized as the most important factor promoting storms and substorms in the magnetosphere, far more important than increased velocity or pressure 
of the solar wind, sunspot numbers, etc.  This connection supports Dungey's idea of an \open magnetosphere,\ though direct evidence by observing interconnecting field lines is rather hard to obtain.,
 Added 2000: Currently the \Polar\ spacecraft is orbiting in an elongated orbit rising above the northern polar cap to distances of up to 9 RE. The magnetopause is usually further away, but at times of 
high solar wind pressure, \Polar\ has found itself in the cusp region and even outside the magnetopause. On May 29, 1996, this happened during a time of strong northward IMF, and features were observed 
which might have originated in this strange sort of reconnection. ,
      At 03:42 Greenwich time on March 24, 1991, the population of high-energyelectrons and protons trapped in the Earth's magnetic field suddenly receivedhuge reinforcements.  The new belt was so intense 
that it knocked out (within afew days) the MARECS-1 communication satellite, and NOAA's weather satelliteGOES-7 was also seriously degraded. ,
       This solar wind fills the entire solar system, well beyond the outermostplanets, but it does not reach the Earth, because we are shielded by ourplanet's magnetic field.  Instead it flows around 
the magnetic obstacle, the waya creek will flow around a rock in its path.  A shielded cavity is formed, the\magnetosphere\ surrounding the Earth; the closest the solar wind penetratestowards the Earth 
is about 10-11 RE  (Earth radii), or some 40,000 miles, on theside of the cavity facing the Sun.,
      Besides expanding clouds, the Sun's outbursts also create great numbers offast ions, enough to fill the inner solar system, each with an energy that canreach several million times that of solar wind 
particles; such particles behavevery much like intense nuclear radiation, and are a danger to the lives of anyastronauts who happen to be on their way to the moon or to Mars, outside theshield of the Earth's 
magnetosphere.  Intense X-rays and radio waves are alsoemitted, coming from high energy electrons which did not manage to escape theSun.,
      Until recently such radiation was credited to solar flares, bright spots thatsuddenly appeared in the Sun's high atmosphere near sunspots, supposedlysignifying energy release in the corona.  But 
in 1973 astronauts aboard theSkylab space station saw something new: huge bubbles of hot gas, expandingupwards much faster than the solar wind, fast enough to push shock waves aheadof them into interplanetary 
space.  Such \coronal mass ejections\ (CMEs) seemedclosely related to the interplanetary shocks which now and then strike themagnetosphere. Each year a few such shocks are strong enough to push themagnetosphere's 
boundary past the synchronous orbit, at 6.6 RE, wherecommunication satellites generally dwell.  Recent opinion has been that CMEs,rather than flares, are more likely to be signs of sudden solar energy 
releasesthat affect the Earth.,
      The research spacecraft CRRES, operated by the US Air Force with NASAparticipation, was at that instant deep inside the radiation belt, at adistance of 2.55 RE. CRRES (pronounced \cress\) stands 
for Combined Release andRadiation Effects Satellite, reflecting the spacecraft's multiple duties--toprobe the radiation belt, as well as to release clouds of barium and lithiumvapor, tracing  motions of 
the magnetosphere the same way as a plume of smoketraces the motion of wind.  CRRES was also a testbed for a variety ofelectronics circuits, to help engineers design electronics and microcomputers toperform 
reliably in space, even in the heart of the radiation belt.  ,
      The first thing CRRES saw was a torrent of highly energetic protons andelectrons.  The protons had energies above 20 Mev, twenty million electronvolts, some 20,000 times the energy of the average 
proton in the solar wind. Theelectrons had about 15 Mev, and the energy of either type was quite sufficientto penetrate a spaceship and cause damage. In the concluding words of ascientific study of this 
event, \it is fortunate that present-day space missionsdo not spend much time in this region of the Earth's magnetosphere.\  On thatparticular day and for a long time afterwards, that region was indeed 
a hotplace to be in.  ,
      Yet we have abundant evidence that ions and electrons in space are indeedaccelerated to high energies, all over the universe: in flares and CMEs near theSun, in elusive \substorms\ of the magnetosphere, 
in the radiation belts ofJupiter and other magnetized planets and in the unknown sources of cosmicradiation, the perpetual drizzle of extremely energetic ions which bombards theEarth.  On March 24, 1991, 
it happened right in front of our eyes, as if by aconjuring trick.  But how?  ,
      Some evidence came from the particles themselves.  Energetic ions andelectrons trapped by the Earth's magnetic field drift around theequator--positive protons clockwise (viewed from north), negative 
electronscounter-clockwise.  The sudden burst of electrons intercepted by CRRES quicklyebbed again, suggesting it was caused by a compact cloud of electrons which soondrifted away.  ,
      Dr. Xinlin Li of Dartmouth College in New Hampshire (now at the U. of Colorado at Boulder) and his colleagues--MaryHudson at Dartmouth, Ilan Roth, John Wygant and Mike Temerin at Berkeley, andBernie 
Blake at the Aerospace Corporation--used a computer to model the path ofthe shock wave and to reconstruct the way it affected electrons already presentin the magnetosphere.  They selected a wide range 
of initial positions andenergies, then calculated the tracks of more than 300,000 electrons, examininghow each of them fared when the wave passed over it.  The result resembled inmany ways the way a surfer 
rides a wave. Electrons starting with unfavorablepositions or energies gained little energy or even lost some; however a fewlucky ones matched the speed of the advancing wave, rode the crest deep into 
themagnetosphere and gained much energy in the process.  In their computersimulation Dr. Li and his colleagues managed to reproduce quite convincingly theinitial pulse and two of the periodic \drift echoes.\ 
,
      Did this explain the way ions and electrons are accelerated in nature?  Notcompletely, because the favored electrons already needed a hefty amount ofenergy to start with, close to 2 Mev.  The abundant 
low-energy electrons in themagnetosphere gained very little energy: like pieces of driftwood bobbing inthe surf, as the shock passed them their energy rose briefly and then went downagain.  Electrons of 
around 2 Mev indeed exist in the magnetosphere, and theyseem to be the ones from which the new radiation was formed.  But their originhas always been something of a mystery: some scientists have even speculatedthat 
they may have escaped from the intense radiation belt of the distant planetJupiter.,
    We now know better: space probes have found that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all have magnetic fields, as does tiny Mercury.  The Moon has patches of magnetized rocks and might have had a field 
when those rocks formed long ago, abd Venus seems non-magnetic. Mars was a mystery until September 1997, when Mars Global Surveyor found it to be magnetized in patches, like the moon but several times 
more strongly. ,
          The sources of other planetary fields seem quite different from the Earth's and one can only speculate about their origin. For instance, does the magnetism of Jupiter and Saturn originate in 
cores of metallic hydrogen, a form which can exist under the enormous pressures at their centers?  And since Uranus and Neptune do not generate enough pressure for hydrogen to become metallic--are their 
internal currents carried by ions dissolved in water or methane ices?   Jupiter(bigger version),
    As for the rest of the solar system: Venus appears to be unmagnetized, and the solar wind penetrates all the way to an \ionopause\ above its dense atmosphere.  In September 1997 Mars was found by \Mars 
Global Surveyor\ to a weak magnet--just magnetized in patches, though some of them were moderately intense.  Tiny Mercury, visited three times by Mariner 10 in 1974-5, is also magnetic, although its magnetosphere 
is so small that long-term trapping probably does not occur in it.  Mariner 10 did see on its night side what appeared to be an abrupt acceleration event, perhaps similar to a substorm.  The \Messenger\ 
spacecraft, currently on its way, is due to reach Mercury in 2008 and attain an orbit around it in 2011.,
    The speed of the solar wind however remains the same, about 400 km/sec. As a result, the wind needs a much longer time to traverse the length of the magnetosphere.,
     With the Earth's magnetosphere, it takes the solar wind about one hour to advance from the ose\ to the distant tail regions where ISEE-3 and Geotail have probed it, some 200 RE downstream.  During 
that one hour the Earth rotates by a rather small angle, 15 degrees, and if \open\ field lines in the lobes connect it to the solar wind, those lines might become twisted by about 15 degrees.,
     If Jupiter's magnetosphere has the same proportions, the solar wind would need 2-3 days to cover the corresponding distance (equal to about half the Earth-Sun distance!), during which the planet might 
have rotated 5-7 times around its axis.  One might therefore expect the lobes of Jupiter's magnetotail (and Saturn's, too) to be severely twisted, and the Galileo mission might be the first opportunity 
to examine this point.  All other probes sent to Jupiter used the planet as a pivot to gain extra speed, the way \Wind\ used the moon, and the orbits required for this maneuver kept them out of the lobes.,

    But they do more than that.  Saturn seems to have an inner belt like the Earth's, and calculations suggest it is produced by cosmic ray neutrons ejected from the planet's rings.  Jupiter's magnetosphere 
is heavily loaded with sulfur ions, believed to originate in the sulfur volcanoes of the satellite Io.  This may also be the source of the sodium cloud around the planet, studied by telescopes from Earth. 
 Jupiter   auroras  (bigger version),
    The planets with the largest magnetospheres, Jupiter and Saturn, rotate rapidly (periods of about 10 hours), and data from space probes has suggested that the plasma surrounding them participates in 
that rotation to a much greater extent than the Earth's, perhaps up to the ose\ itself.  How then do intense radiation belts arise?  Perhaps very powerful magnetic storms overcome the rotation and inject 
them deep into the magnetosphere, or perhaps the process differs from what occurs near Earth.  Again, Galileo might tell.,
    Jupiter's magnetic axis is inclined to its rotation axis by about the same amount as the Earth's.  Its magnetic north-south polarity is the opposite of the Earth's--but it's worth noting that fossil 
magnetic records, in sea-floor rocks, indicate that the Earth's polarity has reversed many times in the distant past.   Saturn's magnetic axis seems exactly aligned with its rotation axis, within the errors 
of the observations, and that has bothered some theorists, since a 1931 theorem by Thomas Cowling stated that a planetary dynamo field cannot be axially symmetric.  However, since the magnetic fields of 
irregularities die out quickly with distance, it can be that observations closer to the planet might find an asymmetry.,
     A \head-on\ magnetosphere.    The real surprise came with Uranus, whose rotation axis is nearly parallel to its orbital plane.  At the time of the 1986 fly-by of Voyager 2, that axis pointed almost 
exactly at the Sun.  Based on their experience with Earth, Jupiter and Saturn, scientists expected the magnetic axis of Uranus to be close to its rotation axis, and to also point more or less sunward. 
 They therefore expected a completely different magnetosphere, a \head-on\ magnetosphere which met the solar wind not with a \hard\ nose of ordered magnetic field lines (as the Earth does), but with its 
\soft\ cusp region (picture on the left). Earth never attains this position.,
    But it wasn't to be.  As Voyager 2 found, the magnetic axis of Uranus was actually steeply inclined to its rotation axis, at nearly 60 degrees, causing it to spin around like the axis of a top that 
is about to topple.  As a result, the direction of the magnetic axis in space varied constantly and rapidly, but it never pointed towards the Sun--though it might do so, briefly, in other parts of the 
planet's orbit.  Neptune was somewhat similar, with its magnetic axis angled by 47 degrees to its rotation axis.,
    All this suggests that not only isn't the Earth's magnetosphere unique, but different kinds of magnetospheres are possible, and some of them can be found in our solar system. Not only do we have in 
our magnetosphere a natural laboratory for studying cosmic plasmas, but different examples of such plasmas are also accessible (though not easily), to be studied perhaps by future generations. We are indeed 
fortunate!,
     Magnetic storms are relatively rare.  On the other hand, smaller \substorms\ observable mainly in polar regions (and in space!) present a clearer pattern and seem to be more fundamental. They are 
also much more frequent, often just hours apart.,
     The two are of course related, and during magnetic storms intense substorms are generally observed in the polar regions.  \Storms\ distinguish themselves by injecting appreciable numbers of ions and 
electrons from the tail into the outer radiation belt, and their world-wide magnetic disturbance reflects a rapid growth of the ring current. Substorms usually do not inject as many particles. It might 
thus be that magnetic storms are merely sequences of very intense substorms, but additional factors are also involved--in particular, magnetic storms require external stimuli such as the arrival of a shock 
front or a fast stream in the solar wind.,
     Large magnetic disturbances are also observed, up to 1000 nT (nanotesla) which is about 2% of the total field in the auroral zone.  The world-wide disturbance observed in a magnetic storm of respectable 
size may only reach 100 nT, but then, its source is much more distant, namely, the ring current which circles the Earth at distances of tens of thousands of kilometers. The electric currents associated 
with the substorm, on the other hand, come down to the ionosphere, only about 130 km above the ground.,
     It is not easy to piece together a pattern from such observations, since most of the evidence comes from isolated satellites.  What seems to happen is that magnetic field lines of the tail are first 
stretched tailwards and are then released, in a way frequently compared to the stretching and rebounding of a slingshot.  As the lines bounce back, they propel and energize ions and electrons in the midnight 
region, at typical distances of 6-15 RE.,
     Secondly, more of the magnetic field is drawn into the tail, and the tail lobes expand, storing additional magnetic energy in them.  It is widely believed that the expanded lobes are the main storehouse 
of energy which powers the substorm.  Sometimes, in \clean\ substorms when the IMF suddenly urns southward\ after a long quiet period, one can observe this reservoir of energy charging up, as the tail 
field intensifies and magnetic field lines in synchronous orbit become increasingly stretched tailwards, slingshot-like.  This \growth phase\ typically lasts 40 minutes.,
     Magnetic reconnection then begins between oppositely directed field lines north and south of the middle of the plasma sheet (the \equatorial plane\), as explained in connection with the open magnetosphere. 
 Each line on the northern side is broken in two at the neutral line, and the parts are spliced to corresponding parts of a line from the southern side, which is similarly divided in two.,
     The broken and reconnected halves of lobe field lines form two new lines.  The one on the earthward side, essentially a stretched terrestrial line, rebounds earthward, just like a released slingshot. 
 The other one is connected tailwards, and because it no longer has any connection to Earth, it is expelled down the tail.  Together with the plasma riding on it (and other plasma, originally further tailwards), 
it forms a sort of a plasma bubble known as a \plasmoid\ (see drawing above). The passage of such plasmoids further down the tail has been deduced from observations by ISEE-3 and Geotail.,
     Initially the newly-reconnected lines are those of the plasma sheet, but as the process sucks in magnetic field lines from both sides towards the neutral line, the tail lobes are soon reached. The 
effect on the magnetic field piled up in the lobes, and on the energy stored in them, is somewhat like that of a pin on a well-inflated balloon.  Just as the pinhole allows air to escape and releases the 
energy stored in the balloon, so the neutral line allows field lines (with their plasma) to leave the lobe, reducing both the intensity and energy of the magnetic field there.,
     Energy in nature is conserved.  If it disappears in one form, it reappears in another: electric energy consumed by a motor is converted to kinetic energy of motion, and when motion is stopped by friction, 
its kinetic energy turns to heat. The magnetic energy taken from the tail lobes also reappears in different forms.,
     Some is turned to heat, that is, it raises the velocity and hence the energy of plasma ions and electrons (heat being the kinetic energy of individual particles moving in disordered fashion--in both 
a gas and a plasma).  The plasma most likely to be heated in this process is the one attached to the reconnected field lines: since those lines come from the tail lobes, whose plasma is extremely rarefied 
(see magnetotail), rather few particles share this energy and therefore the amount each of them receives may be quite big.,
     As noted (section on magnetotail, also drawing on right), a large electric current flows at all times across the plasma sheet, from the dawn edge to the evening edge (and then closes along the magnetospheric 
boundary).  In a substorm some of this current, it seems, is diverted earthwards along magnetic field lines.,
     The diversion starts in the morning-side half of the plasma sheet, where currents are withdrawn to flow earthward along field lines.  They then continue (mostly) in the ionosphere, and finally return 
to space along other field lines, to the evening-side of the tail.  The by-passed section in the middle of the plasma sheet, where the cross-tail current is weakened, seems also to be the region actively 
involved in the substorm, but how the substorm disrupts there the orderly flow of the cross-tail current is still a matter of controversy. The flow of electric currents along field lines may also be the 
key to the production of the substorm aurora, as will be discussed later.,
     Even though the physics is quite different, one can compare a substorm to a thunderstorm.  Meteorology experts have a clear and orderly view of this phenomenon: its energy is supplied by the moisture 
contained in warm, humid air, and a rising flow forms an updraft (like the rising central column in the pot shown in the section on convection), extending to great heights.  One can  describe the processes 
controlling the flow of air in that central \updraft\ and the formation of rain (and even of lightning, a somewhat peripheral phenomenon).,
      But a look at an actual thunderstorm reveals no tidy structure: flows are obscured by clouds, patterns are deformed, neighboring thunderstorms affect each other, and each storm is in fact different. 
An observer watching from the ground may find it hard to draw any conclusions. Launching balloons with instruments into the storm could help, but if only a few are available, their evidence may be contradictory, 
since those that miss the rising updraft move unpredictably.,
 Substorms are like that, too, only more difficult--because of their greater distance and size, the small number of satellites available and perhaps the greater intricacy of plasma phenomena.  Almost all 
we know about them comes from ground observations or from isolated satellite passes, which cannot be readily combined, since each storm behaves differently.,
      Ohm's law tells that electric fields drive electric currents, from high voltage to low voltage. In a conductor such as a wire, electrons move from (-) to (+), while ions (if they are free to move), 
are pushed in the opposite direction, (+) to (-). In space, on the other hand, the the entire plasma is moved sideways, perpendicular to both magnetic and electric field lines. No steady electric current 
results from the electric field, and both ions and electrons advance in the same direction.,
        On the other hand, electric currents often flow in space without any voltage driving them. No electric field is involved--the magnetic field is doing it all, when it has the appropriate structure.,

      This strange behavior is explained below. No math is used, but the arguments are a bit complex--skip this part, if you want. If you decide to continue, go slow: it only takes a short time to read 
this web page, but much longer to understand it.  Make sure to assimilate each part of the argument before going to the next one. ,
        It will be assumed in what follows that the direction of the electric force (\direction of the electric field\) is always perpendicular to the local direction of magnetic field lines. ,
           There exists a reason. In space, ions and electrons spiral around their guiding magnetic field lines, but at the same time they can also slide along those lines, like beads threaded on a wire.,

          Without such fresh energy (the usual case), the electric force along the field line quickly drops to zero. When that happens, the same voltage exists at all points along a magnetic field line, 
leaving no voltage differences that might drive currents in that direction. The remaining electric field is then perpendicular to the magnetic field lines, as in the drawing here.,
       An exception to this rule is discussed in section #28, dealing with the origin of the aurora. There energy is being supplied and the electric force does have a component in the same direction as 
the magnetic field line.,
      For the above reason, the local magnetic field lines in the drawing (repeated here for convenience) are assumed to be perpendicular to the paper, coming out towards you.    Suppose also the electric 
field--representing the electric force--is in the plane of the drawing, towards the top of the figure.   A straight arrow was drawn giving that direction, which we choose to be the y direction in a system 
of (x, y) axes, drawn in the bottom right corner.,
       A negative electron, marked e-, is pushed towards the bottom,  in the -y direction  You can imagine (if you wish) a positive charge somewhere below the drawing, and a negative charge somewhere above 
it, creating that force--repelling or attracting the proton or electron.,
       If the electron and the proton (or other positive ion) were free, they would simply move in those directions.  But they are not free, because of the magnetic force.,
        If only magnetic forces were present (no electric field), the proton would circle around a magnetic field line in the clockwise direction (from where we are looking) and the electron in the counter-clockwise 
direction. These directions are given near the left edge of the drawing.,
       The electric force modifies the motion. Protons are accelerated in the +y direction, so they move a bit faster on the part of their circle closer to the top of the page (see drawing above!).,
      Faster ions or electrons circle with a bigger radius.   They behave a bit like a racing car: the greater its speed,  the wider is the circle it follows when going around a curve.,
        Therefore protons make wider circles at the top of their circles, and electrons make wider circles at the bottom of their circles. This is shown in the drawing, and the result is a slow crablike 
sideways motion (\drift\) in the (-y) direction, by both ions and electrons.  Even though they circle their field lines in opposite directions, the electric field moves them both in the same direction, 
to the right.  ,
      It can also be shown that the velocity of both motions is always the same--even though protons are nearly 2000 times heavier, and even though the initial energies of the particles can be very different. 
(To those familiar with mathematics and physics, this process can be explained much more concisely and transparently.) The result is always a sideways flow of the plasma, a migration of the entire plasma, 
a bulk motion of the gas rather than a flow of electric current.,
         Such an \electric drift\  takes place in the barium cloud (section #8 whose figure is repeated here). The green cloud of neutral barium stays still, while any electric field present makes the 
purple cloud, consisting of ions and electrons, drift away from it (see illustration).  Of course, since ions and electrons remain free to slide along magnetic field lines, the ion cloud also expands slowly 
in that direction (or rather, in two opposite directions--up and down the field lines).,
       Where can such electric fields come from?  Probably from far out in space. As noted earlier on this web page, a magnetic field line tends to have the same voltage everywhere along its length. If 
an electric field is created anywhere on that line, its voltage will be transmitted to the rest of it, and with it, the electric field is also transmitted. Thus an electric field created far in space can 
spread to the end region of the line, where the line comes down into the atmosphere, and where the transmitted field causes barium clouds to drift.-------------- ,
        The radial motion of solar wind ions and electrons must cut across those spirals. How do those particles avoid being forced into tiny spirals around those lines?  By an electric field!  The flow 
of the solar wind is driven by powerful energy sources, which make its motion take precedence, which it does by creating the appropriate electric field. ,
      Suppose as before that magnetic field lines are perpendicular to the drawing, and that the same (x, y) axes are used as before. Only now (drawing on the left) no electric field exists, and instead 
the strength of the magnetic force changes with distance in the y direction--it is much greater at the top of the drawing than at the bottom.,
        As before both ions and electrons circle around magnetic field lines, as drawn (we ignore the sliding motion). However, the size of the circle also depends on the strength of the magnetic force--the 
stronger the force, the smaller the radius of the circle. (In the limit where the magnetic force drops to zero, the particles move in straight lines--same as circles of infinite radius!),
      Because the way the strength of the force changes, the orbits, again, are no longer circles but flat spirals (see drawing), curving more sharply at the top of their motion. ,
        The result as before, is again a crablike sideways \drift.\ This time, however, protons and electrons drift in opposite directions. Protons move to the left, electrons to the right, and both motions 
contribute a right-to-left electric current. ,
        The ring current described in section #9 is of this type. The figure from that section, reproduced here, looks down on the equatorial plane of the Earth, from the north. All field lines point upwards, 
as in the previous drawing, and the strength of the magnetic field increases inwards, towards the Earth. The drift is therefore in the 3rd perpendicular direction, which carries the particles around Earth--electrons 
counterclockwise, protons clockwise, and the current flows clockwise too. The earlier drawing illustrating magnetic drifts may be viewed (qualitatively) as a magnified blow-up of the situation at the bottom 
of the ring current drawing.,
 Although almost 90% of the observed magnetic field can be approximated by a dipole, the 10% left over, called the non-dipole field cannot be ignored. In places it can be large relative to the dipole field, 
thus altering noticeably the shape of the observed field. This is especially true in the vicinity of the North Magnetic Pole, with important consequences. In order to appreciate how the non-dipole part 
of the magnetic field distorts the overall shape of the magnetic field it is important to understand what the dipole field looks like. The three diagrams illustrate the following points.,
 This final point needs further explanation. Contrary to popular belief, a compass needle does not point directly at the North Magnetic Pole. However, if a traveller sets out from some location and proceeds 
in the direction in which his or her compass needle points, he or she will eventually reach the North Magnetic Pole, but by a route that will not be direct. The accompanying diagram shows clearly that 
the magnetic meridians (red) diverge considerably from the direct path to the Magnetic Pole (green). The European example is particularly striking. Although the direct path to the Magnetic Pole requires 
a traveller setting out from southern Europe, at the edge of the map, to head 8 degrees west of north, a compass will lead the traveller almost 3 degrees east of north. By the time the traveller reaches 
Scandinavia he or she is over 18 degrees off course, and at 80 N, almost 46 degrees of course. The compass will lead the traveller past the geographic pole on the wrong (i.e. Siberian) side before it makes 
a sharp left turn towards the North Magnetic Pole.,
 Magnetic meridians should not be confused with magnetic declination. Declination is actually the angle between the magnetic meridian and the geographic meridian (true north) at a given location. Declination 
can vary considerably along a magnetic meridian.,
 Another common misconception is that the North Magnetic Pole is an \attractive\ pole; that is, it attracts a compass needle towards it. In reality, the magnetic field felt by a compass needle is essentially 
uniform over the length of a compass needle and as a result the net force on the needle is zero. This means that the needle is not \pulled\ towards either Magnetic Pole. However, because the compass needle 
is a small dipole with opposite polarity at either end, the northward directed magnetic field of the earth will cause the needle to rotate until it is aligned in the local direction of the magnetic field.,

 The Earth's magnetic field is a vector quantity; at each point in space it has a strength and a direction. To completely describe it we need three quantities. These may be:,
 Magnetic reference field models provide an easy way to calculate magnetic declination and other components of the magnetic field. A reference field model is a mathematical algorithm whose parameters are 
based on an analysis of magnetic monitoring satellites either over the entire world or a part of the world. Spherical harmonic analysis is the most common method used for producing global models. The International 
Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) and the World Magnetic Model (WMM) are the most commonly used models for navigational purposes. Models are traditionally updated every five years. The Canadian Geomagnetic 
Reference Field (CGRF) is a model of the magnetic field over the Canadian region for the time period 1985-2010. It was produced using denser data over Canada than were used for the IGRF, and because the 
analysis was carried out over a smaller region, the CGRF can reproduce smaller spatial variations in the magnetic field than can the IGRF.,
 Since magnetic field models such as the IGRF and CGRF are approximations to observed data, a value of declination computed using either of them is likely to differ somewhat from the rue\ value at that 
location. It is generally agreed that the IGRF achieves an overall accuracy of better than 1° in declination; the accuracy is better than this in densely surveyed areas such as Europe and North America, 
and worse in oceanic areas such as the south Pacific. The accuracy of the CGRF, in southern Canada, was about 0.5°. The accuracy of all models is worse in the Arctic near the North Magnetic Pole.,
 In 1838 the German mathematician and magnetician Frederick Gauss developed a method of representing the magnetic field in terms of a converging series whose terms were functions of latitude, longitude 
and radial distance from the centre of the earth. In modern notation, the representation is:,
 ThePnmare called associated Legendre polynomials which look very much like distorted sine waves. The gnm andhnm are called Gauss coefficients which are determined through a least-squares analysis of a 
world-wide distribution of magnetic observations.,
 In theory the series goes to infinity; in practice some maximum degree, Nmax is chosen so that the series is able to reproduce the observed field to the desired resolution and accuracy. For example, for 
the IGRF, Nmax = 13. To reproduce the field originating within the core of the Earth requires Nmax = 15. To reproduce crustal anomalies visible in magnetic data at satellite altitudes requires Nmax = 80.,

 An extreme example of this type of occurrence was the great magnetic storm of March 1989, which was one of the largest geomagnetic disturbances of the twentieth century. Rapid geomagnetic field variation 
during this storm led to the induction of electric currents in the Earth's crust. These currents caused wide-spread blackouts across the Canadian Hydro-Quebec power grid, resulting in the loss of electric 
power to more than 6 million people (Allen, 1989; Czeck, 1992; Boteler, 1998; Kappenman, 1996, 2003; Thomson, 2010). If a similar storm-induced blackout had occurred in the Northeastern United States, 
the economic impact could have exceeded $10 billion (NRC, 2008; Baker et al., 2009; NRC report, 2009) not counting the negative impact on emergency services and the reduction in public safety associated 
with the loss of electric power in large cities.,
 GIC levels are primarily driven by impulsive geomagnetic disturbances created by the interaction between the Earth's magnetosphere and sharp velocity, density, and magnetic field enhancements in the solar 
wind. These disturbances result in the ground-level time-varying magnetic fields, which, when they reach high levels, produce GICs. On average, 200 days of strong to severe geomagnetic storms that could 
produce GICs on the surface of the Earth can be expected during a typical 11-year solar cycle (DoE-NERC, 2010). However, knowing exact levels of induced currents in power grid infrastructure during a geomagnetic 
event requires knowledge of deep earth conductivities and transmission line design parameters (NERC, 2012).,
 The USGS Geomagnetism Program, in collaboration with the USGS Crustal Geophysics Program, National Resources Canada, the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center and NASA-Goddard GIC are building monitoring 
tools including a US-wide conductivity model, local magnetic field model, and regional electric field estimates.,
     In 1820 Oersted arranged in his home a science demonstration to friends and students.  He planned to demonstrate the heating of a wire by an electric current, and also to carry out demonstrations 
of magnetism, for which he provided a compass needle mounted on a wooden stand.,
   What Oersted saw.   While performing his electric demonstration, Oersted noted to his surprise that every time the electric current was switched on, the compass needle moved.  He kept quiet and finished 
the demonstrations, but in the months that followed worked hard trying to make sense out of the new phenomenon.,
    The magnetic property becomes even stronger if a core of iron is placed inside the coils, creating an \electromagnet\; that requires enlisting the help of iron, but is not essential.,
   Carl Friedrich Gauss    In a 1828 meeting Humboldt suggested to the greatest German mathematician of his time, Carl Friedrich Gauss, that he ought to apply his talents to the mysteries of magnetism. 
Gauss and his associate Weber then built a laboratory to study magnetism, in which, among other things, they devised the world's first magnetic telegraph.,
     Up to that time, the compass needle--and the downward-pointing \dip needle\ on a horizontal axis--measured well the direction of the magnetic force, but what about measuring its strength? Gauss devised 
a clever method for doing so, using an auxiliary magnet; today this is a popular undergraduate lab excercise. ,
    The new tools for better observation and description of the Earth's magnetic field led to better, world-wide observations.  Gauss and Weber organized a \Magnetic Union\ for setting up observatories, 
and Humboldt enlisted Russia's Czar to create a chain of them across Siberia. The greatest help however came from the British empire, whose \Magnetic Crusade\ led by Sir Edward Sabine set up stations from 
Canada to Tasmania (then known as \Van Diemen's Land\). The vast network not only made possible the first global models of the field, but also demonstrated the world-wide character of magnetic storms.,

    One can compare today's magnetic models, some of them based on satellite observations, to the ones started by Gauss more than 150 years ago. One trend then stands out: the dominant \dipole\ field is 
getting weaker, at about 5% per century (the rate might have increased since 1970). In the unlikely event that the trend continues unchanged, about 1500-2000 years from now the magnetic polarity of the 
Earth would reverse.,
     However, the magnetic field of Earth is not likely to disappear, because the high electrical conductivity of the core demands that the magnetic flux entering the core can only change very, very slowly 
(more about \flux\ below). As the late Ned Benton has shown (together with Coerte Voorhies), even though such conservation does not allow flux entering the core to disappear, it may be redistributed--perhaps 
replacing the big bundle of the dipole with a number of more complex ones (4-pole, 8-pole, etc.).  Such replacement yields weaker fields on the surface, and meanwhile the dominant \dipole\ pattern may 
(sometimes) reverse, later growing again to dominate the pattern but (possibly) with the main magnetic poles reversed. ,
        If you had done the same with areas where field lines exit from the core, it can be shown that you would have got the same result, but with minus sign, denoting flux leaving instead of entering. 
If you ignore the sign and mark every contribution as positive, you get exactly the same flux. Calculating the otal unsigned flux\ at the core surface gives the sum of the two--the otal unsigned flux,\ 
equal to twice the entering magnetic flux, and therefore, also (very very nearly) unchanged with time.  The otal unsigned flux\ is however easier to derive (which is why geomagneticians prefer working 
with it), because you no longer need to divide the surface into irregular patches of incoming and outgoing field lines--every bit of area is used in the calculation.-----------------------,
  But the notion of a scientific textbook was unfamiliar when De Magnete first appeared in 1600.  Certainly scientific subjects and even geomagnetism had been written about  (e.g. by Petrus Peregrinus 
in his Epistola de Magnete,  1269), but as reports of equipment and phenomena rather than as in-depth investigations of a subject, with experimental evidence and interpretation.  So there was no yardstick 
against which to measure De Magnete.   Recall that it was not until 1687 that Newton's Principia was published; De Magnete also predates Kepler's Astronomia Nova (1609), in which he enunciated the first 
two of his three laws of planetary motion, and Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (1610), in which the earliest telescopic observations of astronomical objects were reported. ,
      William Gilbert (1544-1603) was the eldest of Jerome Gilbert's eleven children: four from his first marriage and seven from a second.  Confusingly these included a second William who, even more confusingly, 
erected a memorial tablet to \our\ William, but with his year of birth erroneously given as 1540.   The family lived in Colchester, some 50 miles NE of London, where Jerome held the prestigious post of 
Recorder.  William received a gentleman's education at St John's College, Cambridge, where he remained for 11 years until 1569, acquiring bachelor's and master's degrees, qualification as a medical doctor 
and a Senior Fellowship.  This was followed by a four-year \Grand Tour\ of Europe, mostly spent in Italy, before he settled in London in 1573 to practice medicine.  His medical career was spectacularly 
successful, culminating with presidency of the Royal College of Physicians in 1599 and appointment as physician to Queen Elizabeth I in 1601.  The Queen died two years later, though no blame for this attaches 
to Gilbert, who continued to be Royal Physician (to James VI and I) until his own death by plague 8 months later.  It is of interest to note that Mark Ridley, a slightly younger geomagnetician (and acquaintance 
of Gilbert's, whom he commended as the greatest discoverer in magnetical science), was also a royal physician - in his case to the Tsar of Muscovy, Boris Godunov. ,
      Gilbert's achievements as a doctor would have been enough to secure his fame, but he is remembered today for his investigations into magnetism and electricity, which he reported in De Magnete.  These 
investigations were conducted from about 1581 to 1600, in parallel with his medical career.  The experiments were made and discussed with like-minded friends who met in his house for this purpose; a pattern 
similar to that followed half a century later which led to the foundation of the Royal Society.  Although magnetism was essentially a hobby, it was one that Gilbert, who never married, took very seriously 
and on which he expended large sums of money (£5000 according to William Harvey) for instruments and equipment. ,
      The book itself is a handsome production, well illustrated with woodcuts and various printing devices such as illuminated letters at the start of each chapter.  Marginal asterisks, of two sizes, 
draw attention to points of particular importance.   After an author's preface, by Gilbert, and an encomiastic preface, by Edward Wright, there are 115 chapters, sometimes of only one paragraph, arranged 
in 6 books.  Edward Wright (1558?-1615) is famous for putting Mercator's projection on a sound mathematical footing.  The book is not unlike a modern PhD thesis in layout, starting with a survey of previous 
work, moving on to experimental results, discussing these and setting them in the broader context of worldwide results, and ending with speculation and unsolved problems. ,
      The first book starts with an historical survey, then reviews the basic magnetic properties of a lodestone (poles, attraction and repulsion, magnetisation of iron) and ends with the famous chapter 
on the Earth itself being a great magnet. There is an interesting discussion of the medicinal properties of iron and lodestone, in which it is concluded that magnetism plays no part, since: \when drunk 
in a draught\ [lodestone does not] \avail to attract or repel\. ,
      In the second book a clear distinction is drawn between the attractive properties of magnets and rubbed amber: \for it pleases us to call that an electric force\.  Many magnetic and static-electric 
experiments are reported, including investigations of the effects of interposed material, shape of lodestone and the effect of \arming\ the poles with iron caps.  Much folklore is refuted, not least the 
possibility of a perpetual motion machine: \O that the gods would at length bring to a miserable end such fictitious, crazy, deformed labours, with which the minds of the studious are blinded! \ ,
      Book three is concerned with the directive properties of a magnet, but also with details of the magnetisation of needles and the distribution of magnetism in a terrella (Gilbert's word for a spherical 
lodestone).  The terrella experiments are of particular importance, since it was these that led Gilbert to draw the analogy between the magnetic field of the Earth and that of a terrella. ,
      This introduction to geomagnetism is developed in more detail in book 4 (on declination, which was then known as \variation\) and book 5 (on dip, which Gilbert calls declination). ,
      The final book is more speculative.  It concerns stellar and terrestrial motions, which Gilbert erroneously associates with magnetism and believes that this adds support to the Copernican theory. 
 This was unacceptable to religious views at the time and many of the European copies of  De Magnete have had Book 6 removed or defaced.  Nevertheless, the idea of action at a distance for controlling 
the planetary motions was seminal for Hooke's and Newton's thoughts about gravity. ,
      But a mere list of its contents can give only a hint of the book.  It is constantly necessary to remind oneself while reading it of just how early it is.  Here is Baconian science, based on experiment 
and observation rather than hearsay, being practised twenty years before the publication of Bacon's Novum Organum.   And, over a hundred years before it ceased to be an offence punishable by flogging for 
a British naval helmsman to have garlic on his breath for fear of demagnetising the ship's compass, De Magnete dismisses as \fable and falsehood\ the idea that a lodestone smeared with garlic loses its 
power.  All this at a time when it was heresy to set experiment against the teachings of the church; indeed, it was also in 1600 that the philosopher Giordano Bruno was burnt at the stake for heresy.  
Admittedly, things were more relaxed in England than in Italy, but it was still courageous, perhaps even foolhardy, to publish such a book. ,
      The quoted price of De Magnete may be a little misleading as, even without the benefit of this review, all four Latin editions, of 1600, 1628, 1633 and 1892 (a facsimile of the first edition) are 
sold out.  While second-hand copies occasionally appear at auction, they are not cheap: a good first edition was recently (January 1998) sold for $15,000.  The 1900 Chiswick Press edition in English (translated 
by Thompson) was limited to 250 copies and is now virtually unobtainable, but was reprinted in facsimile in 1958 by Basic Books, edited and with an introduction by Derek J. de Sola Price.  A reprint of 
Mottelay's translation was published by Dover in 1958 and is still in print. ,
      Once the reader has got used to its inevitably archaic style, De Magnete is a surprisingly readable book.  There is no need to commend it to historians of science as they will already have read it. 
 But any geophysicist would not only benefit from, but also enjoy reading it. ,
    A typical electromagnet, such as is used in a relay or machinery, has an iron core around which the current-carrying coil is wound.  The coil's magnetic field is greatly strengthened by the iron, because 
the iron atoms (or arrays of such atoms arranged in crystals) are magnetic. ,
    In ordinary iron, the magnetic axes of its atoms point in random directions, and the sum of their magnetic fields is close to zero. When current flows in the coil, however, its magnetic field lines 
up the magnetic axes of atoms in the core, and they add their magnetism to the one created by the electric current alone, making it much stronger.,
     Materials exist--certain ferrites--where saturation occurs abruptly and completely, at a stably defined level. If a large enough alternating current is driven through a coil wrapped around a core 
of such material, the core's magnetic polarity flip-flops back and forth, and saturation occurs in each half of the cycle, in symmetric fashion.,
     If however such an electromagnet is located in an existing magnetic field, directed (entirely or in part) along the axis of the ferrite core, that symmetry is upset. In the half of the cycle in which 
the field of the coil is added to the existing magnetization, saturation arrives a bit earlier, because it depends on the total magnetic intensity, external plus that of the coil. In the other half of 
the cycle, where the magnetization due to the coil opposes that of the existing field, it happens a bit later, because the sum of the two is somewhat weaker than the field of the coil alone.  That asymmetry 
can be sensed electronically, and this is the basis of the operation of the fluxgate magnetometer.,
     It does not sound like a sensitive effect--but it can be made quite sensitive by various tricks (e.g. replacing the rod-like magnetic cores with rings). A typical intensity of the magnetic field near 
the Earth's surface is 50,000 nanotesla (nT), while the fluxgate aboard Voyager 2 has observed with fair accuracy the interplanetary magnetic field near Uranus or Neptune, typically 100,000 times weaker. 
The Voyager 2 instrument resides at the end of a long boom, keeping it away from the magnetic interference of the currents aboard the spacecraft. Even though such currents are quite weak, they create enough 
of a magnetic field to disturb the readings of the sensitive magnetometer.,
      Such instruments must be calibrated against known fields from a coil or in some other way.    Other types of electronic instruments also exist, e.g. those based on optical properties of certain metal 
vapors, but they are beyond the scope of this quick overview. Another kind  is the proton precession magnetometer, briefly described in a lesson plan of the web course \From Stargazers to Starships\ and 
involving the process of precession. It is the basis of \magnetic resonance imaging,\ a medical procedure for viewing \soft\ internal organs which x-rays cannot observe, without any of the radiation damage 
which x-rays cause .,
     Perhaps the most striking use of such an instrument was in the medical experiments of Dr. David Cohen at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  Cohen's lab was lined with screening coils 
whose current canceled most of the outside geomagnetic field.  Inside the lab he built a small room which shielded out any remaining magnetic influence. It had five sets of walls nested one inside the 
other, like Russian matrioshka dolls, separated by alternate layers of iron (to keep out constant magnetic fields) and aluminum (to shield against electromagnetic fluctuations).  ,
     No detectable magnetic field reached the interior of the room, and some extremely sensitive magnetic observations could be conducted there. Cohen experimented there with magnetic signals from the 
heart and the brain, but his most intriguing result, published in 1979, concerned the human lungs.  Air passages in the human body are lined with hair-like cilia, constantly waving back and forth and thus 
slowly sweeping out any dirt or debris deposited in them (Cohen called them he moving carpet\).  To find how well the lungs cleaned themselves in this fashion, Cohen had a dozen volunteers inhale small 
amounts of iron oxide dust, which is harmless but can be magnetized.  ,
     Over the year that followed the quantity of dust remaining in their lungs was measured periodically, as follows.  First each subject stood between a pair of coils, through which a large current was 
briefly passed.  This magnetized the dust grains inside the lungs and lined them up in the same direction; since the grains gradually shifted out of alignment, they needed to be remagnetized at each visit. 
 The subjects then climbed into the shielded room, where the strength of the magnetization of their chest area was measured.,
      During the year of observations the amount of dust declined steadily in all subjects, first steeply and then more gradually, ending at about 10% of the original level. This showed that the lungs 
cleaned away debris quite efficiently.  The surprise came from 3 additional subjects, added  as an afterthought, all of them heavy smokers.  Their lungs cleaned themselves much more slowly, and after one 
year, about 50% of the dust still remained. ,
    Cohen concluded that heavy smoking not only deposited tars in the lungs but also impaired their capacity to clean themselves.  He speculated this might explain why a combination of heavy smoking and 
exposure to asbestos was associated with lung cancer far more frequently than might be expected by simply adding together the effects of smoking and asbestos separately. Not only did the asbestos promote 
cancer, but the tobacco tars and smoke hampered the natural process by which the lungs were sweeping it away.,
      That was before other planets in the solar system were visited and examined. Now we know that among those planets, only Venus lacks any magnetism. The planets differ greatly in size and properties, 
and their fields differ too. Yet they all seem to have dynamo fields, or (in the case of Mars and the Moon) have had them in the past. ,
      In 1959, after the Earth's radiation belt had been discovered, Frank Drake observed Jupiter and concluded from the relative intensities in a range of wavelengths that the signal was probably emitted 
by electrons trapped in a strong magnetic field. Then in 1973 the space probe Pioneer 10 passed by Jupiter and found there, sure enough, an enormous planetary magnetic field and a very intense radiation 
belt.,
     If the fields of Earth and Jupiter were both approximately represented by bar magnets at the planet's center, then Jupiter's magnet would be about 20,000 times stronger. Jupiter's magnetic axis, like 
the Earth, is slightly offset from the rotation axis, but while Jupiter and Earth (and other planets) spin in the same sense, the magnetic polarity of Jupiter is the opposite of Earth's. ,
     What produces that field is still unclear. No one knows what Jupiter's core consists of, but by one widely held theory, it is hydrogen, compressed by the huge weight of the planet's outer layers to 
the point at which it becomes a metal and conducts electricity. The strange radio signals observed by Franklin and Burke came from Jupiter's radiation belt, the most intense one in the solar system--so 
intense that after just one pass through it, Pioneer 10 suffered some (minor) radiation damage. Along with its radiation belt, Jupiter also has auroras, observed from Earth by the orbiting Hubble telescope. 
,
   Jupiter   auroras  (bigger version)      Jupiter's magnetic field produces some interesting interactions with the planet's larger moons (which are bigger than ours). Io, the innermost large moon, is 
heated by its tides, a bizzare world with active sulphur volcanoes and a thin atmosphere. Its ionosphere and/or body conduct electricity, and the relative motion between Io and Jupiter's magnetosphere 
creates a dynamo circuit, which produces large currents flowing between them.,
      The space probe Voyager 1 passed close to those currents on March 5, 1979, and observed their magnetic fields. Those fields also affect Jupiter's radio emissions and cause the \signal\ which they 
beam to Earth to rise and fall, depending on the position of Io. More recent observations by the Galileo space probe also suggest that the moon Ganymede has its own magnetic field. Jupiter's magnetosphere 
at these distances rotates with the planet, and as it moves past Ganymede, that moon apparently carves out it it its own small magnetosphere. ,
      The magnetic axes of Uranus and Neptune, on the other hand, are inclined by about 60° to their rotation axes. The shape and properties of a planetary magnetosphere depends on the angle between the 
flow of the solar wind (i.e. the direction from the Sun) and the magnetic axis, and for those two planets, that angle is rapidly changing all the time. As a result, their magnetospheres undergo wild variations 
during each rotation, although both manage to contain trapped particles. The origin of all those field is unknown: Saturn is big enough to produce metallic hydrogen in its core, but Uranus and Neptune 
are not. ,
      The planet Venus was visited by Mariner 10 in 1974, which continued from there to Mercury. Venus was found to be unmagnetized: the solar wind is only stopped by its upper atmosphere, the ionosphere, 
creating a completely different type of magnetosphere, more like a comet's tail. On the other hand, tiny Mercury--an airless rock only moderately bigger than our Moon, rotating very slowly--surprised observers 
by being magnetized. Its magnetic field is weak and probably does not extend far enough to trap many particles, but as the spacecraft passed through its nightside tail, it observed a sudden spasm in which 
particles were apparently energized. To learn more about all this, NASA has scheduled the \Messenger\ mission to fly to Mercury and orbit it.     Mercury may actually have a molten core, and thus perhaps 
its field may be due to a dynamo effect, like Earth's. Mercury is slightly deformed like the Earth's Moon, but whereas our Moon's rotation period equals its orbital period, Mercury is locked into  a more 
complex pattern--3 rotations each 2 orbits.     Because Mercury's orbit is slightly elliptical, it also undergoes librations, causing the Sun to pull its elongated part. The librations differ whether the 
core is molten or not--if it is, the Sun's periodic pull is not transmitted so well to it and it rotates more smoothly. According to an article by Jean-Luc Margot et al., Science 316 , p. 710, 2007 (reported 
by Johanna Miller in \Physics Today\, July 2007, p. 22-4), this seems to be the case \with 90-95% certainty.\ The Messenger mission is expected to make the case more definite.      Mars and the Moon have 
permanently magnetized patches of rock on their surfaces, suggesting that even if they now lack a dynamo field, at some time in the past they possessed one. That would agree with the giant volcanoes (apparently 
extinct) observed on Mars, which suggest a hot interior. ,
   Magnetization of Mars: red in one direction,       blue in the opposite one.    For more details, see   Astronomy Picture of the Day, 4 May 1999     The magnetized patches on that planet, first observed 
by the Mars Global Surveyor, are particularly intriguing because they seem to form strips, reminding researchers of the magnetized strips observed on the sea bottom on Earth, from which the idea of plate 
tectonics emerged. Magnetic observations on Mars, however, are not yet detailed enough to allow any firm conclusions to be drawn. ,
      Planetary magnetic fields thus seem to be the rule, not the exception, at least in our solar system. About a thousand years have passed since the discovery of the magnetic compass gave the first 
hint of such fields. As their study enters its second millennium, it faces more unanswered questions than ever before. ,
       Birkeland's terrella     Kristian Birkeland, a Norwegian physicist, took in 1895 a hint from William Gilbert and placed a terrella--a magnetized sphere representing the Earth--in a vacuum chamber 
made of glass. He then aimed a beam of electrons at the terrella (somewhat like the beam of electrons in a TV picture tube) and observed their path by means of the glow they produced in the residual air 
left in the chamber. The glow followed magnetic field lines (lines of force) and converged near the magnetic poles of the terrella. ,
      It indeed was.  The French mathematician Henri Poincaré--and 50 years later, in more detail, Hannes Alfvén in Sweden--analyzed the motion of such electrons and concluded that they were  guided by 
magnetic field lines, like beads strung on a wire. From his terrella experiment, Birkeland guessed that the aurora was caused by electrons from the Sun, which were guided by magnetic field lines to the 
Earth\s polar caps, and produced there a glow as they hit in the upper atmosphere. As it turned out, the Sun was not the source, but the rest of the guess was pretty close to the truth. ,
    Alfvén's theory suggested how this current could be carried. Charged particles, such as ions or electrons, were not only guided by magnetic field lines, but as they slid along such lines (more accurately, 
spiralled around them), they were also repelled (in a way) from regions of more intense magnetic field. ,
       Motion of a Trapped Particle   Field lines of the Earth, like those of a bar magnet, stretch from the vicinity of one magnetic pole to that of the other, and the magnetic force on each line is weakest 
halfway between the line's \footpoints\ on Earth, in the part where the line is most distant from Earth. Ions and electrons can be trapped in that weak field, bouncing back and forth, turned back each 
time they try to slide down into the more intense field which exists closer to Earth. ,
      One can show that by secondary processes, such particles also slowly change their attachment from one field line to its next neighbor, gradually circling the globe--clockwise (view from far north) 
for positive ions, counterclockwise for negative electrons. However, any time negative electrons move one way and positive ions the opposite way, an electric current is created! That was indeed how S.F. 
Singer in 1957 proposed to explain the existence of a ring current during magnetic storms. ,
       Regions of the Magnetosphere     The energy source of the ring current and of all its associated phenomena turned out to be the solar wind--a continuous flow of ions and electrons, spreading out 
in all directions from the Sun's topmost layer, the million-degree hot corona. Magnetic storms arise from unusually fast flows in the solar wind, especially those connected to explosive events associated 
with active sunspots. The solar wind compresses the magnetic field lines facing it on the day side of the Earth and confines those lines into a rounded cavity. In the opposite direction, on the night side, 
the same solar wind stretches field lines into a long \magnetotail\ and the cavity then becomes a long cylinder. ,
      It is this tail where many active phenomena of the magnetosphere--part of our \space weather\--originate. Of special interest is a thick layer known as the plasma sheet, spread in the region of weak 
magnetic field which is sandwiched between two bundles of magnetic field lines. One bundle, north of the equator, consists of field lines that head into the vicinity of the north magnetic pole, and the 
other bundle is its mirror image south of the equator, of field lines directed out of the southern polar cap. The plasma sheet is where ring current particles originate, and where \substorms\ shove particles 
earthward and create bright auroral displays. ,
      In space such currents most easily flow along magnetic field lines, because the particles that carry them (mainly electrons) tend to stay attached to such lines. Some flow from space to Earth, some 
from Earth to space, and near Earth their circuit is completed by a layer in the high atmosphere that conducts electricity well, the E-layer of the Earth\s ionosphere, located some 125 km above ground. 
The currents do not reach the ground, because air at lower levels is a very good electric insulator. ,
      The polar aurora is created by electrons moving earthward while carrying this current. They gain speed from the driving voltage and after reaching the atmosphere, smash into atoms of oxygen or nitrogen, 
causing them to emit light. The typical aurora has an eerie greenish glow, emitted by oxygen. ,
     Gilbert thus believed the Earth rotated because it was magnetic. P.M. Blackett, who won the 1948 Nobel prize for his work on cosmic rays, seriously considered the opposite possibility--that the Earth 
was magnetic because it rotated around its axis. Blackett at one time suggested that perhaps a new universal phenomenon existed--that any rotating object was intrinsically magnetized. ,
       At first this did not seem such a wild idea. Electrons and protons, for instance, do have an intrinsic \spin\ giving them properties like those of a rotating solid object, and they also have an 
intrinsic magnetization, making them tiny magnets, lined-up with their spin axes. In ordinary materials, such atomic magnets point in all possible directions, so that their effects cancel. ,
        Energy is the currency with which most processes in nature must be paid for.  The Earth's magnetism is no exception, and its energy seemes to come from fluid motions in the Earth's core, from circulating 
flows that help get rid of heat produced there. In a similar way, our weather is driven by circulating air flows that help cool the ground, where much of sunlight is absorbed. ,
       Scientists are still not sure about what provides the heat in the Earth's core. It might come from some of the iron becoming solid and joining the inner core, or perhaps it is generated by radioactivity, 
like the heat of the Earth's crust. The flows are very slow, and the energy involved is just a tiny part of the total heat energy contained in the core. ,
       So the molten metal is believed to be circulating.  By moving through the existing magnetic field, it creates a system of electric currents, spread out through the core, somewhat like Faraday's 
disk dynamo,  discussed earlier. Currents create a magnetic field--a distribution of magnetic forces--and the essence of the self-sustaining dynamo problem is to find solutions such that the resulting 
magnetic field is also the input field required for generating the current in the first place. ,
       Actually, that is only the lowest level of the problem, in which one is free to prescribe the motions. To solve the full problem,  we also need information about the heat sources, and these sources 
must be able to drive motions which also solve the dynamo problem. ,
       The rotation of the Sun around its axis, therefore, does not by itself contribute to its magnetism. What is important in this case is that the Sun does not rotate like a solid ball. Its equator 
has a shorter rotation period than higher latitudes-- about 25 days for the equator, 27 days for latitude 40 degrees (the Earth meanwhile moves some distance around the Sun, so from here the period seems 
to be 27 and 29 days). If Earth rotated that way, Florida (for instance) would soon pull away from the rest of the US, into the Atlantic Ocean. Such an uneven motion, deforming the surface, can drive a 
dynamo, and in the Sun's case, it is indeed believed to be the source of sunspot magnetism. ,
 Walter Elsasser, at the University of Utah (later at Johns Hopkins) launched in the 1940s a frontal attack on the full 3-dimensional problem. He got nowhere: the equations became more and more intricate 
and complicated the further one went into the details. Others had similar experiences. Only in 1964 did Stanislaw Braginsky in Russia publish the first valid solutions, by assuming that the field was almost 
axially symmetric and calculating its small deviations from symmetry. ,
       The solution of the full problem,  including heat flow, is much harder. Not only are we unsure of the source of heat, but any motions caused by it are greatly modified by the Earth's rotation. That 
modification is a major feature of large-scale motions in the atmosphere, causing hurricanes and storm systems to swirl in their characteristic ways. Eugene Parker in 1955 proposed a mechanism by which 
such swirling, in the rising flows of the Sun's atmosphere, could create dynamo fields. ,
       As viewed from above, the swirling direction of storms in the atmosphere is always counterclockwise north of the equator and clockwise south of it. Such asymmetry is also expected in rising flows 
in the Earth's core, and Steenbeck et al., in Germany, showed in 1966 that thanks to it, disordered convection patterns can indeed produce an average \dynamo field. \ That became known as the \alpha effect, 
\ because it involved a mathematical quantity denoted by the Greek letter a (alpha)--but the details are far too complicated to be described here. ,
       A Japanese team of Takahashi et al (Science, 309, p. 459-61, 15 July 2005) has more recently used one of the worlds fastest supercomputers to carry out a similar calculations assuming a much lower 
fluid viscosity in the core, much closer to the actual one.  The behavior seems even closer to the one observed.,
 The Ionosphere is part of Earth’s upper atmosphere, between 80 and about 600 km  where Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) and x-ray  solar radiation ionizes the atoms and molecules thus creating a layer of electrons. 
 the ionosphere is important because it reflects and modifies radio waves used for communication and navigation. Other phenomena such as energetic charged particles and cosmic rays  also have an ionizing 
effect and can contribute to the ionosphere.,
 The atmospheric atoms and molecules are impacted by the high energy the EUV and  X-ray photons from the sun.  The amount of energy (photon flux) at EUV and x-ray wavelengths varies by nearly a factor 
of ten over the 11 year solar cycle.  The density of the ionosphere changes accordingly.  Due to spectral variability of the solar radiation and the density of various constituents in the atmosphere, there 
are layers are created within the ionosphere, called the D, E, and F-layers. Other solar phenomena, such as flares, and changes in the solar wind and geomagnetic storms also effect the charging of the 
ionosphere.  Since the largest amount of ionization is caused by solar irradiance, the night-side of the earth, and the pole pointed away from the sun (depending on the season) have much less ionization 
than the day-side of the earth, and the pole pointing towards the sun.,
     Answering the first is relatively straightforward, but the answer is long, it's a big area.  Don't expect more than a general outline and leads to where to find more. I hope you find the time and 
the will to follow those leads,  because teachers need a deeper understanding than what students see.,
      Answering the second is tough. The physics curriculum in high school is generally limited to one year; so even though it is jam-packed, it still misses a lot. If you add any new topic, an existing 
one may end up pushed out.,
       The earth sciences class often taught in 9th grade may be more accommodating, but of course students know little physics at that stage, and the same goes for earlier grades.,
     However, these sites have an additional use.  Most classes will have a few strongly motivated students, who feel held back by the pace of the class and get bored.  They would like to rush ahead--but 
of course, the teacher cannot speed up to where the majority is no longer comfortable. Instead, they can be sent to explore on their own areas such as magnetic fields on Earth and in space, and in a moment 
I will explain how.,
     It discusses the magnetism of the Earth itself (also, of the Sun--there exists a connection) and is therefore useful for use in Earth Sciences class. It includes guidance for Earth science teachers 
who might want to use it.,
     The third and largest is \From Stargazers to Starships,\  an algebra-based course on basic astronomy, Newtonian mechanics, solar physics and spaceflight. It deserves a separate talk, at least, but 
since it touches on solar-terrestrial physics only peripherally, and I was asked here to tell you only about the magnetosphere and the Sun, I will leave it out for now.,
       The Earth acts like a giant magnet, behaving somewhat as if it had a powerful bar magnet at its center.  Just as a bar magnet does have two poles where its attraction is strongest, so does the Earth, 
and its two magnetic poles are near the two geographic poles, which define the axis of rotation of the earth.  \Near\ here means about 1000 km away. The needle of a magnetic compass points towards those 
poles, which is how the Earth's magnetism was first noticed--probably in China, some 1000 years ago. ,
       Now the magnetic field--the region of magnetic influence--is 3-dimensional. A compass needle must be horizontal, but similar needles with a horizontal axis, free to point up or down at any angle, 
showed that the magnetic force actually did not just point northward but also into the Earth (north of the equator). The closer one got to the magnetic pole, the steeper was the inclination, until at the 
northern magnetic pole, the needle pointed straight down.  That in fact was how the north magnetic pole was located in 1831, by an expedition funded by Booth's whisky distillery, which is why the location 
is now called the Boothia peninsula.,
       Michael Faraday had the bright idea of describing magnetic fields in 3-D by imaginary lines which are everywhere lined up with the magnetic force, the direction shown by a magnet freely suspended 
in 3-D. (By the way, you can buy such magnetic probes, on gimbals,  for the classroom--the source is listed on the web site). He called them \lines of force.\ Where the lines lie on a flat plane, you can 
outline them by iron filings, as kids do in the classroom.,
       We nowadays call such lines \magnetic field lines\ and they are extremely important in magnetic fields in space, because they control the physics. Most space is filled with a gas (usually rather 
rarefied) consisting of freely floating electrons and positive ions--atoms which have lost one or more electrons, giving them a positive charge. Such a gas is called a plasma, it conducts electricity and 
tends to get attached to magnetic field lines.    ----------------------,
     Let me pause herefor some comments on the teaching of physics.  Among my books, I have somewhere a 1913 edition of the physics text by Millikan and Gale (the famous Millikan who measured the electric 
charge of one electron). Printed in black and white, small enough to fit a coat pocket, it covers its physics pretty well, even though its pictures of airplanes and cars will make you smile.,
       Today's students actually seem to get less physics, because so little time is provided.  Yet we now have much more physics to teach!  The subject has expanded tremendously!  There was no magnetospheric 
physics in 1913--besides electronics, nuclear energy, black holes, and so forth. How can a teacher cover it all? ,
       To be honest--I don't know.  I don't think it can be done.  The most you can do is arouse the interest of your physics students, and hope they continue on their own. To do so, it is essential that 
they be good readers,  because almost all the material is only in books. Indeed, to master any technical subject nowadays, one has to be a fluent reader, another subject where schools seem to fall behind. 
Without reading, a kid's future career may be on the loading dock or in a hair salon.   ----------------------,
     As part of the ew physics\ added since 1913, you expect students to have some understanding of atoms, electrons, ions and plasmas. It is very important that any time a new term is introduced, it is 
clearly defined. Take \magnetic field.\ Many teachers just casually drop the term, as in oday you will learn about the magnetic field of the Earth.\ ,
       You will note that this was not done here, but a magnetic field was defined as he region of magnetic influence,\ where magnetic forces may be observed.You should do no less in your class. Actually, 
\field\ means more--in the 20th century, it became to be understood as \a region where space itself is modified.\ An \electromagnetic field\ is then a region where space is modified by linked electric 
and magnetic forces, and it can propagate electromagnetic waves--such as radio, microwaves, light or x-rays.,
        You will find these subjects addresses in \Exploration of the Earth's Magnetosphere\ and also in sections of \Stargazers\ about the Sun.  You will see how clues for atoms arose from chemistry, 
for electrons you can tell about an interesting experiment by Edison (although there is much more!), and that free ions were found in \alpha particles\ emitted by radioactive substances, although much 
earlier chemistry had already found ions in solutions of acids and salts in water.,
       It is next to impossible to give kids a broad understanding of all these.  But at least let them realize, that claims of science are based on observations--observations which often leave no room 
for alternative explanations.,
     As an example--how do you tell your students about plasmas?  The simplest is tell them about the fluorescent tube (and make sure they do not spell it \fluorescent\, as in \flour\!). ,
     \Exploration\ has a section on that.  In the gas inside a fluorescent lamp, there are always a few electrons and free ions, created by radioactivity and other causes.  You now apply anelectric voltage--and 
you define voltage as a \sort of electric pressure,\ one that drives currents through wires, just as pressure along a pipe can drive a flow of water through it. The voltage accelerates electrons and ions, 
they collide with atoms, knock off more electrons so that more and more are created, driving a bigger and still bigger electric current.,
       Ultimately something will limit the current--you don't want wires to melt (or circuit breakers to turn off the flow), so a ballast coil is used (or more recently, special electronics). The plasma 
current then stabilizes, and as new ions are created, \old\ ones recombine with their electrons, and in the process, produce light. Some of that is ultra-violet, but the whitish \fluorescent\ paint inside 
the tube converts this into visible light, creating a very efficient la,
     mp.   Unless you give such examples, \plasma\ is just a word found in the book. The magnetosphere of course is filled with a plasma of free electrons and (mainly) protons, ions of hydrogen. As noted 
earlier, all these are attached to magnetic field lines, a bit like beads on a wire. Unlike beads, though, they can sometimes jump from one field lines to the one next to it.,
        This attachment can work in two main ways. If the magnetic field is strong, it forms a rigid framework that can trap the plasma, which is what you get in the radiation belts.   ,
       If the magnetic field is weak,  and the plasma contains more energy-per-unit-volume than the field, then the plasma dominates. For instance, if the plasma flows, it will bodily drag the field lines 
with it, deforming them, and section (18A) of \Exploration\ has a paper exercise on this effect. ,
       Also, the likelihood of seeing an aurora depended on distance, not from the geographical pole but from the magnetic one. There exists an \auroral zone\ where the likelihood is greatest, a circular 
belt about 2000-2300 km from the magnetic pole, and at greater or smaller distances, the probability quickly drops.  The \lower 48 states\ are likely to see aurora mainly during big magnetic storms, when 
electrical currents in space shift the auroral belt to lower latitudes. Still, the US is lucky here--the magnetic pole is on our side of the geographic pole, so one does not have to go as far northwards 
to see aurora as one does in Asia (on the opposite side) or even in Europe.      ----  -----  -----  -----  -----     Many other discoveries were made  in the early 1800, and I cannot possibly cover them 
all here.  The fundamental nature of the magnetic force was uncovered in 1820-21 by Oersted and Ampere: not some peculiar property of special iron, that is just an accident of nature, but a force between 
electric currents. No time for details--you can find them on the web, and also, I will discuss them this afternoon,  in a separate talk.    ----  -----  -----  -----  -----  ,
       But in addition, the 11-year sunspot cycle was discovered--not by an astronomer, but by a German pharmacist. Heinrich Schwabe was an amateur who chose as his task the search for an unknown planet 
inside the orbit of Mercury, for which the name Vulcan was proposed.  The glare of the Sun would make it hard to see such a planet (except during a total eclipse), so Schwabe tried to catch it while passing 
in front of the Sun's disk,  the way Venus did during its recent transit.,
       The planet would appear as a dark spot , and to tell it apart from sunspots, Schwabe started tracking sunspots, too.  He never saw Vulcan--it does not exist--but after 17 years he realized the number 
of sunspots went up and down in a definite cycle.,
         That was in 1843, just a few years after the first world-wide network of magnetic observatories was established--that story is on the web, too--and these recorded events when the magnetic field 
simultaneously underwent a world-wide change.  The change was small, typically a weakening by a fraction of 1%, but the pattern was identical, all around the world, so it clearly was something BIG. Alexander 
von Humboldt named those events magnetic storms,  and around 1852 Sabine in Britain found that their likelihood was greatest near the peak of the sunspot cycle. Magnetic storms could also cause displays 
of the polar aurora far south of their usual location, so indeed, something was happening in outer space.,
       A few years later a British astronomer, Richard Carrington, was observing a group of large and active sunspots, when suddenly a bright spot of light appeared among them.  Luckily, some other astronomer 
also saw it, so there was no doubt, and it seemed hard not to connect it with a large magnetic storm which erupted less than 24 hours later, with aurora seen as far south as Cuba. ,
       The eruption which Carrington saw is now called a solar flare,  and using special light filters, flares of all sizes can be regularly monitored; only very rarely can some be seen in unfiltered light, 
as in Carrington's flare. They do occur near sunspots, and are definitely associated with magnetic storms.  The association was better understood after the discovery of coronal mass ejections or CMEs, 
huge bubbles of hot gas, blown away from the Sun. Their first extensive observations were made in 1973 from the space station Skylab.   ,
       The big plasma bubbles apparently are the cause of big magnetic storms.  In addition, however, flares or associated events--scientists still argue here--also accelerate ions to fairly high energies. 
So high, that some can even be occasionally detected on the ground, even though the atmosphere has the shielding power of about 10 feet of concrete. To astronauts on Mars, or on the way to Mars, such radiation 
can border on the dangerous (depending on how big the event is). No wonder NASA is interested in what it calls \Space Weather.\,
        So magnetism, the aurora, sunspots and magnetic storms were all somehow closely connected. Sunspots, too, were intensely magnetic areas, as analysis of their light showed. What was going on? ,

     A Norwegian physicist named Kristian Birkeland traced the motion of electrons in a vacuum chamber, with just enough gas left in it to light up along the path of those electrons.  They seemed to be 
guided by magnetic field lines to the region near the poles, somewhat like the aurora.  Birkeland suggested that sunspots threw out clouds of electrons, some of which reached Earth and were then guided 
magnetically to the polar regions, and that was how we got the aurora. ,
       But calculations showed clouds consisting just of negative electrons could not exist, electrons repelled each other too strongly. Two British scientists, Sydney Chapman and Vincent Ferraro, made 
the case in 1930 for clouds containing equal amounts of negative electrons and positive protons, what is nowadays called a plasma, and we now know that  magnetic storms indeed start with the arrival of 
such a cloud. ,
       After this the process gets complicated, but one result is that a large number of positive ions is injected onto field lines near the Earth, where they get trapped. The trapped ions create a huge 
electrical current circling the Earth's equator (at distances between 2 and 6 Earth radii), called (naturally!) the \ring current.\ Another result is that some electrons, already residing on magnetic field 
lines of the Earth, do get accelerated downwards along those lines, hit the atmosphere and cause the light of the aurora.,
     Those details, however, were still unknown in 1957-8, chosen as the first \International Geophysical Year\ (IGY), when the first Earth satellites were launched. Russias first 3 Sputniks,  and Explorers 
1 and 3,  built by the team of James Van Allen at the University of Iowa. ,
       Again, I must skip many juicy details, and can only state here that the Explorers discovered the inner radiation belt,  of fast protons trapped by magnetic field lines of the Earth.  In the years 
that followed, other satellites observed the outer radiation belt--that's where the ring current is found, the long magnetotail on the night side where much of the auroral originates, and a complicated 
interplay of plasmas and electric currents, which we are still trying to understand. ,
       The year 1958 was also when the solar wind was first proposed by Eugene Parker.  It had been observed that the outermost atmosphere of the Sun is very hot, about a million degrees. What heats it 
remains a mystery--it is much, much hotter than some layers below it--but what Parker realized was that the gravity of the Sun could not possibly hold on to such a hot atmosphere.  ,
       Instead, it gets blown off at a tremendous speed, though it is so rarefied that the process can go on and on for a long time.  Some of the earliest evidence for it came from comet tails, as is demonstrated 
on this slide, of Comet Hale-Bopp of 1997.  Note it has two tails, in different directions. The white one is dust, believed to be blown away from the Sun by the pressure of sunlight. Its spectrum is the 
same as that of the Sun.,
       The other has been identified by its spectrum as consisting of ions. Ions are not easily pushed by sunlight, but are easily moved by the solar wind.  They come at a different angle, because the 
solar wind only moves at about 10 times the speed of the comet, and the velocities combine to give an angle that is not exactly away from the Sun.,
     By the time the solar wind reaches the Earth's orbit, blowing at about 400 kilometers per second, it is quite rarefied, and the Earth's magnetic field manages to keep it off, carving its own cavity 
in the solar wind. Tommy Gold of Cornell in 1959 named this region \magnetosphere\ and we still use his term, although the shape is anything but spherical, in particular, on the night side it has a long 
\magnetotail\ whose field lines stretch on and on.,
     The magnetosphere is big.  On the sunward side its boundary--called the magnetopause--is about 11 Earth radii or 70,000 kilometers distant, it grows and shrinks with the velocity and density of the 
solar wind, which determine the pressure on the magnetopause.  On the sides it reaches about 15 Earth radii--a quarter of the distance to the Moon--and on the night side a long tail extends very far, well 
past 200 Earth radii.,
       Over the years satellites have explored that region and found a complicated system of electric currents, driven by the solar wind.  The trapped plasma of the outer belt carries the ring current, 
which gets much stronger during magnetic storms. Other currents flow in and out of the auroral zone, and their flow also causes much of the aurora. During magnetic storms the field is deformed and the 
position of the currents is temporarily shifted, which is why aurora is then seen closer to the equator.,
       Some of these currents are shown in the simple 3-dimensional cutout model of the magnetosphere, which you can download from \Exploration\ and xerox for your students.    ----  -----  -----  ----- 
 -----        There is much too little time to tell the full story. I can't possibly do so here, but you will find much more on the web site. Instead, let me end by going back to the first question. What 
do you tell students--about the magnetosphere, and about magnetism?,
       From the e-mail I get, they are also worried about the Earth's magnetic field reversing and dire effects this is said to produce, such as exposing us to radiation from space (Hollywood has not helped 
here!). ,
       By teaching about magnetism and showing it is actually related to electric currents and well understood, teachers can fill an important gap. For instance, they can tell the story of Oersted and 
repeat his experiment on a vu-graph (the sites tell how).  They can then tell how magnetic fields have no significant effect on the body, even in the strong field of an MRI machine (Q&A #52 in \Exploration\, 
also #64). Also, even if a magnetic reversal removes our magnetic shielding (as happens even now in some polar regions) we are still protected by the atmosphere (Q&Q #1, especially #1B).  It helps to understand 
magnetism.,
       In conclusion, I hope you realize how big this subject is, and anything I can tell about it is sketchy and incomplete. But you will find more on the web.     ----  -----  -----  -----  -----  ,

       We are here within driving distance of Worcester, Mass, the home town of Dr. Robert Goddard, close enough perhaps for people to have a local interest in him.  And we are about 3 weeks away from 
October 19, which was Dr. Goddard's personal holiday, his \Anniversary Day.\   ,
       On that day in 1899, Robert Goddard, age 17, sitting in a cherry tree and daydreaming (instead of pruning dead branches, as he was supposed to do) had a vision of spaceflight, and decided to dedicate 
himself to its realization. \I was a different boy when I climbed down from that tree\ he later wrote. ,
       You might want to use the occasion to tell your students about Robert Goddard, and maybe get them more interested in space. You will find more on the web, at    http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Sgoddard.htm,

     Most dry land has a modest elevation above sea level, while most of the ocean floor is about 3 kilometers (or 2 miles) lower down. The area of in-between depths, e.g. where the ocean is about 1 kilometer 
deep, is much less. An atlas will show that in the oceans around the continental US, for instance, for a certain distance from land the depth slowly increases, but then the sea-bottom plunges down steeply 
to the lower level, where it stays. ,
      What does this mean? It means that the surface of the Earth is not a single terrain, varying smoothly, part of which happens to stick out above water. Rather, its regions belong to one of two types. 
 The oceans tend to be uniformly deep, while the continents are separate chunks, thick enough to rise above water (or, at their edges, be covered by shallow seas). ,
      Wegener found other corresponding matches, e.g. between rock formations along matching edges, and in 1918 he proposed his theory of \continental drift\--that continents, like ice floes, drifted from 
one location to another. He believed the continents floated on deeper layers below them, which over millions of years gave way like a thick fluid and made the drift possible. The energy source was supposedly 
the internal heat of the Earth. ,
      Wegener's idea encountered enormous resistance from established geophysicists. Sir Harold Jeffreys in Britain, in particular, pointed out that the deeper layers were not nearly fluid enough and would 
strongly resist the proposed motion. After Wegener died on an arctic expedition in 1930, only a handful of loyal supporters continued to promote his ideas. More evidence was needed, and it came from the 
Earth's magnetism. ,
      Instruments can measure the magnetization of basalt. Therefore, if a volcano has produced many lava flows over a past period, scientists can analyze the magnetizations of the various flows and from 
them get an idea on how the direction of the local Earth's field varied in the past. Surprisingly, this procedure suggested that times existed when the magnetization had the opposite direction from today's. 
All sorts of explanation were proposed, but in the end the only one which passed all tests was that in the distant past, indeed, the magnetic polarity of the Earth was sometimes reversed. ,
 Please Note:This web site regularly receives questions about reversals.  Do they pose a danger to life on Earth? Is one due soon? How quickly do they take place? Click here to bring up four of those questions, 
with their answers.,
      Extending those measurements to the oceans, around 1960, revealed a surprising difference. In the ocean floor the magnetization was orderly, arranged in long strips.  The strips on the Atlantic ocean 
floor, in particular, all seemed parallel to the \mid-Atlantic ridge.\ That is a volcanic ridge running roughly north-to-south (with some zigs and zags), halfway between Europe-Africa and America. It is 
marked by the focus-points of earthquakes and by some volcanic islands, and more recently it was explored by research submarines, which have at times observed lava oozing out at its crest. ,
                   Ocean floor magnetization     (USGS figure)     Not only were the magnetic strips lined-up with the central ridge, but their structure and distribution seemed remarkably symmetric on 
both sides: if (say) a narrow-wide pair of strips was observed at a certain distance east of the ridge, its mirror image was also found at about the same distance to the west. ,
      As the \plates\ on each side are pulled away, lava emerges from the middle, solidifies and \records\ the prevailing magnetic field. The newly formed basalt sticks to the plates and is also pulled 
away--some of it towards Europe and Africa, some towards America. Every half million years, on the average, the Earth's magnetic polarity reverses, and so does the magnetization of the ocean floor. Each 
strip therefore represents an epoch of one or the other magnetic polarity, and the symmetry is also explained. It is as if the sea-floor was a giant tape recorder, with twin tapes emerging from the mid-Atlantic 
ridge, recording the Earth's magnetism at the time they emerge and then traveling in opposite directions.  Similar magnetic strips were also observed in all other oceans. ,
         Sea-floor spreading     (USGS figure)     If the sea-floor was moving, then continents adjoining them might share that motion, just as Wegener had guessed. The main difference now seems to be 
that rather than pushing their way through a semi-fluid on which they float, the continents (or some of them) ride on top of \conveyer belts\ in that fluid. These are the \plates\ which emerge at mid-ocean 
and go down again (at least in some cases) at the deep oceanic trenches, like the ones found near Japan or in the Caribbean Sea. ,
      The science of the shaping of the Earth's crust goes by the name ectonics,\ and the process described here is the essence of \plate tectonics\ by the Earth's crust consists of distinct plates which 
are continually rearranged, sometimes carrying along continents or parts of continents. The entire motion is indeed driven by the Earth's internal heat. ,
      The Pacific plate bordering California, for instance, is slowly rotating, moving northwards. The edge of California is attached to that plate and also moves northwards, but the bulk of the continent 
does not. The juncture between the two, where one slips by the other, follows in part the famous San Andreas fault. ,

        Alaska is known as a good place for seeing the polar aurora,  also known as \Northern Lights.\ Originally the phenomenon was named \Aurora Borealis,\ Latin for orthern dawn,\ since in the lower 
48 states or in mid-Europe it may appear (on the rare occasions when it does) as a glow on the northern horizon, as if the sun was rising from the wrong direction. But the southern hemisphere has the same 
phenomenon, with the glow coming from the south,  so scientists prefer to call it simply the \Polar Aurora.\,
         Most visitors to Alaska never get to see an aurora, because they come in the summer, when skies are rarely dark enough. Alaskans claim that only around August 16 does the sky get dark enough to 
see stars, which is when aurora stands out. After that date, your best bet is to go to Fairbanks--and since the brightest auroras occur around midnight (or later, due to Alaska's time zone), you might 
have to stay up a long time. Perhaps it is better then to ask the night clerk at your hotel to ring you up if a good display becomes visible. ,
       What does it look like?  Most often, you see greenish white ribbons stretching across the sky, roughly from east to west, usually with waves in them. In Fairbanks they could be overhead, in northern 
Norway or Sweden too, sometimes even in Winnipeg. Further south those ribbons tend to be near the northern horizon. And if you look closely at them, you will note that they contain many parallel rays, 
running across their width (see picture below).,
       Two things about those rays. One,  the bright ones fade while dim ones brighten instead--a bit like flames in a fireplace, and just as mesmerizing. Some auroras are deep red, and these may be just 
a shapeless glow--or they may have rays, too. And second,  the direction of those rays is related to the magnetism of the Earth.,
        Anyone who has ever used a compass knows that the Earth is a giant magnet. The needle of the compass usually points towards one of two points, the magnetic poles of the Earth, located near the 
geographic poles. But because the compass needle is mounted horizontally, it does not show everything. Actually, the magnetic force points not just northward but also slants down into the Earth. Compass 
needles carefully balanced on a horizontal axis (\dip needles\) point in that slanting direction, when allowed to swing in a north-south vertical plane. In fact, the angle gets steeper the closer one gets 
to the magnetic pole. At the pole the force is vertical. The rays of the aurora faithfully follow that slanting direction. ,
       That was one clue that the aurora was related to the Earth's magnetism. The other clue was found by keeping tabs on how often aurora was seen in various locations. It turned out that the important 
factor was distance from the magnetic pole.  That pole is separated from the geographic pole, marking the Earth's rotation axis, and currently it is in the Arctic Ocean, just north of Canadian soil.  The 
fact it is displaced towards America means Americans do not have to go as far north to see aurora as do, say, residents of Siberia, on the other side of the globe. Locations about 1500 miles from the magnetic 
pole are where aurora is seen most frequently: further away or nearer to the magnetic pole, they get more rare (they are quite rare at the magnetic pole itself). Fairbanks, Alaska, at the edge of the \auroral 
zone, \ makes a good observation post.,
       What you usually see there are those quiet curtains and ribbons. But not always.  At some times they change shape rapidly, advance, retreat or bulge out in a violent fashion, and they also get quite 
bright. Scientists call such an active, violent outburst an \auroral substorm, \ and satellites still study the release of energy, far in space, which causes it. If you are lucky you may also see a \corona\--a 
burst of rays radiating in all directions. That is a caused by perspective--like the rays of the sun setting behind a cloud--and it means it the rays of the aurora are arriving right overhead.   ,
       Is the polar aurora rare?  Depends on where you are!  If your home is in Fairbanks, or in Tromso, Norway, or Fort Churchill, Canada--not at all. You won't see it every evening, but it is present 
frequently enough. In Washington D.C., or London, or Beijing, however, it is a rare event, seen only when the Sun creates \stormy conditions.\ On such occasions--especially near the peak of the 11-year 
sunspot cycle--the Sun sends out a dense cloud of hot gas, whose arrival disturbs the Earth's magnetic environment and produces a so-called \magnetic storm\ (more details, further below).,
       Magnetic storms expand the auroral zone to locations more distant from the magnetic pole--such as Washington, London or Beijing--and also create bright auroras. If this happens on a clear night, 
residents in those cities can see an aurora, but it is a rare treat for them. On the right is a satellite image of an aurora extending to the \lower 48 states\ of the US (note Florida, outlined by its 
city lights). Later that day, in March 1989, the aurora actually spread much further southward, but no satellite was in position to photograph it then. The next picture below is of a 2001 aurora seen in 
Purcellville, Virginia.,
       To early observers, and well into the 20th century, the polar aurora was a great mystery. Not everything is solved even now--but thanks largely to space satellites, we have a fair understanding 
of the way the aurora is produced.,
        First question--  how high up is it?  By comparing photographs taken from separated locations, an altitude of about 60 miles was found for the green aurora, and up to about twice as much for the 
red one. Clues like that led scientists to conclude that \something out there\ was shooting towards us beams of   fast electrons, somewhat like the ones painting the picture inside a TV picture tube. In 
a TV, electrons hit a screen, come to a stop, and their energy is converted to light. Something similar happens with the electrons that cause the aurora: they collide with atoms in the upper fringes of 
the atmosphere, give up their energy to those atoms and cause them to emit light. ,
            And what are electrons? Tiny particles with   negative electric charge, contained in all matter. At the center of every atom is a   nucleus,  containing almost all of its mass and always carrying 
a   positive electric charge. The positive charge attracts electrons and binds them, and jointly the two types yield an ordinary atom, electrically neutral, with no excess charge of either kind. Atoms 
like this build up you, me, and anything we can see on Earth.,
        Red aurora over Virginia, 5 Nov.'01.    Details here  However, sunlight can separate electrons from atoms of the gas found in space (or in the upper fringes of the atmosphere), into   negative 
free electrons and   positive \ions\, atoms missing an electron or more. And because that gas is so rarefied, it can take very, very long before an electron finds a vacant nucleus and recombines again. 
So, free electrons are plentiful there.  Still, electrons moving at 1/10 the velocity of light, like those in the aurora, need a better explanation. We will get to that, by and by.,
        The   green and red colors are emitted by atoms of   oxygen after they are hit by fast electrons.  Each element emits its characteristic colors, and for rarefied oxygen, these appear to us green 
or red. Typically, a delay of 0.5-1 second exists between collision and the emission (in this case--not in denser surroundings!), and that is why the rays of the aurora brighten and fade so slowly. The 
beam of electrons which \excites\ the oxygen atoms may only last a small fraction of a second, but the afterglow persists 0.5-1 seconds or more.,
       And what connects the pattern of the aurora to the region of the Earth's magnetic forces--the \magnetic field\ of the Earth, as that region is known? For such a region, extending far into space, 
a convenient method is needed to describe it there. Such a method is provided by   magnetic field lines,  or as they were once called, \magnetic lines of force.\,
        Chances are you have seen a drawing of the   field lines of a bar magnet.  They fan out from one pole, bend around in big curves, and then converge on the other pole. The magnetic pattern near 
Earth is like that, too--it is as if the Earth had a small (but oh so powerful!) bar magnet in its center: the lines fan out from the region near the south magnetic pole, reach their greatest distances 
above the equator, then converge again near the north magnetic pole.,
        To define field lines more exactly, imagine you had a compass needle hanging in space, able to tell us the   exact direction of the magnetic force, in 3 dimensions. Such a needle will always point 
in the   direction of the magnetic field line at its location. North of the equator such lines converge towards the region near the north magnetic pole, just like those of a bar magnet.    Birkeland and 
his terrella.  ,
          Back to the aurora.    Between 1895 and 1907 the Norwegian physicist Kristian Birkeland tried to study its behavior in a lab. Inside a glass vacuum chamber he mounted a sphere with a magnet inside--he 
called it errella,\ Latin for \little Earth\-- and directed towards it a beam of electrons. To his surprise and gratification, the magnet steered the beam right to a patch around the magnetic poles of 
his small sphere, producing there, as it hit,  a visible glow.  He probably thought--  aha, so that is how it is done! ,
       It turned out (and I skip a lot) that negative electrons and positive ions alike are   guided in space by magnetic field lines. They tend spiral around them, meanwhile sliding   along them, like 
  beads on a wire.  Because Birkeland's field lines reached the terrella near its magnetic poles, that is where his electrons came down. Similarly magnetic field lines of the Earth guide electrons of the 
aurora to come down in the auroral zone. No wonder the rays of the aurora pointed along such lines! Each was produced by a ray of electrons, riding its own field line down to the atmosphere. But where 
did those electrons start from?  ,
        Physical processes usually require a source of   energy to drive them. Think of energy as a kind of   money,  paying for every physical process! Any object moving at great speed needs energy to 
do so--its \kinetic energy\--and if the aurora contains beams of electrons moving at 1/10 the velocity of light, something must have paid the price, must have provided the energy.,
        Not surprisingly, it is the Sun.  Indeed, why not? After all, the Sun powers almost every process on Earth: the food we eat, the coal and gasoline we burn, the winds that blow and the rain which 
waters the land--none would exist without the energy provided by sunlight. With the aurora, however, it is   not the light of the Sun, but something more subtle, the so-called   solar wind. ,
         During a total eclipse of the Sun one can see the outermost layer of its atmosphere, the corona,  a glowing halo around the darkened Sun. It turns out (by examining its light) that the corona 
is incredibly hot--about a million degrees centigrade, nearly 2 million Fahrenheit. Such extreme heat will tear electrons off any atom, turning the corona into a \soup\ of free ions and free electrons, 
a strange gas known as a   \plasma\ which (among other things) conducts electricity.  If you use fluorescent tubes, or have watched neon lights--it's the plasma inside them (not as hot as the corona) which 
carries their electric current and produces their light.,
       The plasma of the corona is far too hot for the Sun's gravity to hold it captive. Instead, it constantly expands away from the Sun and is blown off as the   solar wind,  filling the solar system 
and reaching Earth, and far beyond, past Pluto's orbit. The Earth's magnetic field, however, is an obstacle which the solar wind cannot penetrate. Like a river meeting a rock, it splits up and is diverted 
to flow around it.  Around the Earth a cavity is formed, protected from the solar wind and known as the Earth's   magnetosphere.   And just as a rock in a river leaves a long shielded wake behind it, the 
Earth's magnetic space has a long tail on the night side--some call it the Earth's \magnetotail. \ ,
        But even though the solar wind is kept out, it manages to transmit some electric energy to the magnetosphere, by brushing against it--in particular, to the   tail region.  Let me say here at once, 
the tail is where most electrons of the aurora seem to come from, which is why in Fairbanks the brightest aurora tends to occur around   midnight--even in arctic winter when the sky is dark at most other 
times, too. ,
      At home, energy is carried by   electric currents that flow from electric outlets to lamps, appliances and TV.  The energy of the solar wind   also reaches the magnetosphere (at least in part) by 
means of electric currents. Satellites have observed those currents near Earth: they flow in and out of the auroral zone, along magnetic field lines--for the main circuit, in on the morning side of midnight, 
out on the evening side, the two branches connecting (since any electric circuits must be closed!) through the high atmosphere, which (as noted) conducts electricity. One might   perhaps say that we are 
still searching where the plug is. ,
       Maybe the situation is not quite that dark. A lot is known. But the complete picture--where we can say \it has to be so, there exists no other way\--  that we still lack.,
        Radiation belts were discovered by the first US artificial satellites, Explorer 1 and Explorer 3. In October 1957 the Soviet Union shocked the US by unexpectedly launching its two \Sputnik\ satellites, 
while the \Vanguard,\ the US entry in the \space race,\ crashed in flames during launch, in full view of cameras. The sagging US prestige was redeemed a bit in early 1958 when instruments aboard the above 
satellites, designed and operated by the University of Iowa team under James Van Allen, detected a   permanent belt of trapped ions, surrounding the Earth. They turned out to be protons--atomic nuclei 
of hydrogen atoms stripped of their single electron.,
        Earlier it was claimed that electrons or protons tended to be guided by magnetic field lines, like   beads on a wire.  The ones which guided radiation belt particles had a typical shape--they came 
out of Earth's southern polar region, described a wide arc across the equator, and returned back to Earth near the northern pole. ,
       But if the analogy with beads on a wire were complete--wouldn't trapped particles slide to the ends of those wires, then hit the Earth  and get lost?  Quite true--except the analogy is not perfect. 
 The ends of those lines also experience a much stronger magnetic force, being much closer to Earth than other parts, and   that can be shown to repel those \beads.\ By being repelled from regions of strong 
magnetic force, trapped electrons and ions avoid reaching the atmosphere. Instead of getting absorbed, they get \mirrored\ back and forth--in some cases, for years!   ,
       The same process is also essential to the aurora.  We already mentioned large electric currents flowing from the tail into the polar regions and back again, flowing along magnetic field lines, earthward 
on the morning side of midnight, outbound on the evening side (for the main circuit--a secondary one also exists).  They were first mapped in 1973 by two US scientists, Al Zmuda and Jim Williamson--not 
with a well-supported space research mission, but using a small experiment and a bummed \piggy-back\ ride with a navigational satellite of the US Navy. Those currents are now known as \Birkeland currents, 
\ honoring the Norwegian who first shot electron beams at a magnet in vacuum.,
       The currents along magnetic field lines in space turn out to be carried almost entirely by electrons--descending towards Earth west of midnight, rising up again east of it (being negative, their 
flow opposes that of the current). In light of what was noted a little earlier about the \mirror force\ which repels trapped particles from regions of intense magnetic field, one may well wonder how this 
force affects the flow of electrons which carry those currents. ,
        Where electrons move upwards, the mirror force is no problem--on the contrary, it helps push the electrons away from Earth, towards weaker magnetic fields. However, it is a different story where 
electrons come down.  With radiation belt particles, the mirror force keeps them safely away from the atmosphere--but here, those electrons better reach the upper layers of the atmosphere (where the current 
can continue horizontally to the other branch). If not, the electric circuit remains unclosed!,
       So what happens? In our homes no electric currents will not flow unless a sort of electric pressure pushes them on--a pressure we call \voltage.\ In the home it measures 110 volt, average value 
(actually it fluctuates, being AC). Space currents also have a voltage pushing them, something like 40,000 volts.,
       In the home, if an obstacle is placed in the circuit--an electric resistance, such as a lightbulb--the voltage concentrates there to helps push the current through the bottleneck. Same thing in 
space!  There the bottleneck is the mirror force at the ends of the field line, and to overcome it,  something like 5000-15,000 volts are concentrated there,  pushing those electrons through. The voltage 
speeds them up to about 1/10 the velocity of light, and when they hit the top of the atmosphere, they produce a bright glow. That is the polar aurora! ,
          Aurora observed by      an imaging camera      aboard DE-1Well--at least, one kind of aurora. Other kinds exist, too. The magnificent \ring of fire\ around the magnetic pole, displayed on images 
from satellites (like the one here, on the left), is actually a different kind. It is too faint for the eye to see, but easily seen by spacecraft. ,
        But the bright arcs we see from the ground are usually associated with electrical currents flowing from Earth into space--to somewhere in space. (It may be confusing, but age-old convention has 
it that currents flow from (+) to (-). Therefore, when negative electrons come down, the currents they carry flow upwards.) To recapitulate, the electrons must overcome the \mirror force\ of the strong 
magnetic field near Earth, which tries to keep them out, and they do so with a concentration of voltage.,
        And a proof exists. The mirror force is strongest near Earth, where the intensity of the magnetic field is greatest, so one expects the voltage to be greatest there, too. And since that voltage 
is the source of energy of auroral electrons, they should only acquire it pretty close to Earth.  Indeed, satellites show that those electrons are only speeded up near Earth, in the last 2-5000 miles before 
they hit.,
       Not all such currents are directly connected to the solar wind. A very bright and violent type of auroral arcs--associated with the \auroral substorms\ mentioned before--seem to be produced (in 
part or totally) inside the magnetotail. In such cases the tail behaves a bit like a slingshot.  The solar wind pulls its field lines and stretches them to the limit. Then, when they get released and bounce 
back, they create (for a while--say half an hour to an hour) strong electric currents, and many, many auroral electrons.,
        The Sun gives out sunlight, and its hot corona produces the solar wind,  the source of the aurora's energy. But the Sun is also magnetic--with a large-scale polar magnetic field (a bit like the 
Earth's), as well as sunspots,  compact regions of concentrated magnetism. These too influence the aurora--through the interplanetary magnetic field, carried out from the Sun by the solar wind (won't go 
into that), and through occasional magnetic storms.  ,
       Most people have heard about sunspots--dark markings on the sun (a sunspot group is pictured on the left). Their number rises and falls with an irregular cycle of about 11 years, and some people 
have speculated (not too convincingly) that it matches the rise and fall of climate, the stock market, warfare and more.,
       That cycle was first noted by an amateur astronomer in 1843--more than two centuries after sunspots were first discovered (by Galileo and others). Astronomers had missed it completely, leaving it 
to Heinrich Schwabe, a German pharmacist and amateur astronomer.  Schwabe searched for a planet orbiting close to the Sun inside the orbit of Mercury, tentatively named \Vulcan.\ You only see stars at 
night, so to detect one very close to the sun, you either need a total eclipse of the sun, or else you look for a dark spot crossing in front of the Sun's disk.,
       Schwabe looked for that spot every sunny day, and to distinguish it from sunspots (which rotate with the sun and move much more slowly), he kept tabs on sunspots as well. In 17 years he found no 
planet, but discovered instead that the number of sunspots rose and fell in a regular cycle.,
       As noted, sunspots turned out to be intensely magnetic. Associated with them are outbursts of magnetic energy, which fling fast clouds of plasma--faster than the usual solar wind--in all directions. 
One sign of outbursts are flares,  sudden brightenings which also create a flood of x-rays. (These are not dangerous to astronauts, but the fast protons ejected at the same time can be). Another are \Coronal 
Mass Ejections,\ big bubbles of gas blown off the sun, reported in 1973 by astronauts on the space station \Skylab.\,
       Whatever causes them, these clouds sometimes arrive near Earth and agitate its magnetosphere in a magnetic storm.  The result, as noted, are bright auroras, pushed to locations much further from 
the poles.  That is why, usually in years around the peak of the sunspot cycle, many more people get a glimpse of the polar aurora.,
        All the above is just a short and superficial overview of the science of the polar aurora--and I won't even try address the lore and literature. Let me conclude with two somewhat exotic aspects--artificial 
auroras and auroras on other planets. ,
       Auroras, as was said, are caused by beams of electrons hitting the high atmosphere. So, if we mount an electron gun on the space shuttle or on some other spacecraft, and aim it down--can we create 
aurora?,
       In principle, yes, but in practice it's not easy to match Mother Nature. Remember, all auroras displays are at least 60 miles above our heads. It takes a lot of power to create a glow visible at 
that distance--especially, one as large as an auroral arc!. Experiments have been carried out--notably, the French-Soviet \Arkad\ experiment above northern Russia (also some by the US), and spots of light 
were detected, but it took sensitive instruments to see them.,
        However, other more drastic ways also exist--such as exploding a nuclear bomb above the atmosphere, since a bomb produces great numbers of fast electrons. Such explosions were suggested by an unconventional 
Greek scientist named Nicholas Christofilos. He started out as an engineer designing elevator systems, but his real interest lay in magnetic fields and in the motion of ions and electrons in them.  His 
interest led him to discover an important idea in the design of accelerators for nuclear research, known as \strong focusing.\ He wrote to Columbia University in the US, describing what he did, but scientists 
there did not pay enough attention to the ideas of an elevator engineer in Athens. They sent a polite reply and dropped the idea. A few years later, a Russian came up with a similar concept.,
      However, the US Air Force remembered Christofilos and invited him to this country.  Because he was interested in the trapping of particles, Christofilos proposed creating an artificial radiation 
belt around Earth, by exploding a small nuclear bomb above the atmosphere. ,
       No one suspected the existence of a permanent natural radiation belt, but some small nuclear bombs had been exploded by the US Air Force high in the atmosphere, near Hawaii. They created glows in 
the sky with the colors of the aurora, and people in Honolulu oohd and aahd over them--I have a dim memory that \Life\ even ran a picture.  So Christophilos prepared his bombs (to be flown on a rocket), 
while Russia prepared its Sputnik and Van Allen got ready for Explorers 1 and 3.,
       Sputnik was launched in October 1957, Explorer 1 was launched on the last day of January 1958,  the newly discovered radiation belt was described that May, and the 3 bombs of \Project Argus\ were 
exploded in August and September 1958, above an empty stretch of the South Atlantic. No observation broke the secrecy of the project, and no newspaper told about it at the time.  But the bomb's electrons 
were guided by their magnetic field lines to their other end, near the Azores Islands, and produced a bright aurora which was seen by observers aboard ships deliberately stationed there. The \artificial 
radiation belts\ from the bombs lasted about 2 weeks and were monitored by Explorer 4, built by Van Allen for that purpose.,
       Four years later the US Air Force decided to repeat the experiment on a grand scale west of Hawaii, using a hydrogen bomb,  about 1000 times more powerful. This time the auroral electrons were guided 
towards Samoa--close to the equator, in a region where auroras had never been seen. But the explosion was too close to the equator, in a region where trapping was much more efficient. The radiation belt 
hung around for years, not weeks, and quickly destroyed 3 satellites (including a British scientific satellite NASA had just graciously launched), by degrading their solar panels and depriving them of 
power. The Soviet Union also exploded H-bombs in space, but the following year brought the international test ban and all such experiments ended.,
       NASA spacecraft have shown that the giant planets--Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune--are all magnetic, and do have radiation belts. Jupiter,  the biggest, outdoes them all--its \central magnet\ 
is about 20,000 times stronger than ours. It also has auroras,  photographed by the orbiting Hubble telescope (see here for a recent picture).  Their origin (at least that of the stronger ones) is interesting.,

       As noted, Earth's aurora is associated with electric currents, and so is Jupiter's. Jupiter has 4 large moons (as big as ours or bigger), and the innermost one, Io,  is a strange and hellish place, 
with its interior heated by tides, producing sulfur volcanoes and molten lakes. As a result, it (or the atmosphere around it) conducts electricity, and as Jupiter's magnetic environment rotates past it 
(just as the solar wind flows past Earth), electric currents are produced along the field lines linking it to Jupiter. ,
       We know about those currents because Voyager 1 flew close to them in 1979 and observed the magnetic pattern they produced. And we know the observed auroras are due to those currents, because the 
structure of Jupiter's magnetic field has been mapped. Using that mapping to trace magnetic field lines from Io to the surface of the planet, one arrives exactly at the spots where auroras are seen.,
        You need understand better the difference between the effects of electric and magnetic field, say on electrons, the particle which carry electric currents in wires.       Electric fields PUSH electrons, 
and can give them energy--they do so to electrons in wires the way pressure drops pushes water through pipes.       Magnetic fields are more subtle. Out in space, where electrons are not bound to wires 
but fly through space, magnetic fields can DEFLECT them to different directions, but do not give them any energy. That is how the Earth's field can trap radiation belt particles, year after year after 
year: it has a great effect on their motion, but because the field needs not spend any energy on doing so, it is not weakened at all.   It also means that you can get no \free energy\ from this source. 
       A CHANGING magnetic field does create an electric field, and therefore CAN impart energy. Magnetic storms involve such changes, and can drive \Earth currents\ which have been measured. They can 
even add (at near-polar latitudes) extra currents to the electric grid, which have been known to cause damage, because they resemble DC, and the grid is designed for AC.    For more than that, you will 
have to study more about electricity and magnetism.,
 Is there an equation to work out the effects of time while travelling at light speed? e.g  If I were to travel at the speed of light to Proxima Centauri and it took me 4.23 years, how much time would 
pass by on Earth, etc. ,
   Relativity is not my field, but I believe time would stand still. Also, you could never go that fast, because an infinitely strongforce would be required. But if you could, arranging to send back a 
radio signal when you arrived, the signal would come back 8.46 years after you have left, whereas to you the trip would be instantaneous. ,
   I general, time in your frame passes faster as you approach the speedof light (I am sure you can find the formula), compared to the passage of time in a frame of reference not sharing your motion. Funny 
things mayhappen as you approach that limit. Someone once told me (you can check in Birmingham) that viewed from the outside, objects falling into a black hole seem to take forever to reach the \event 
horizon\ beyond which theycannot be tracked. This, of course, assumes the information is conveyedby light, which gets drastically red-shifted as they approach that limit.However, in the frame of the falling 
object itself, only a finite time will have passed. ,
 --     \To how much radiation you would you have to be exposed to be affected?\ Depends on your definition of \affected.\ Some people say ANY radiation increases your long range cancer risk, but the effect 
of low doses is probably small. A dose of 500 REM has  a 50% chance of killing you(treatment helps, but not a lot), a dose of 100 REM probably increases your long range cancer prospects on the same order 
as cigarette smoking. Cosmic rays give you a lifetime dosage of about 2 REM--rock radioactivity probably a comparable amount, depending on where you live. ,
 --    What is REM? Stands for \roentgen equivalent man.\ The Roentgen started as a unit of x-ray dose measured by the number of electrons it tore from atoms, per unit mass (\man\ means that every part 
of the body got that much radiation). Later people realized that some radiations had a greatereffect on health than x-rays (for the same electron detachment) so radiation from other sources was converted 
to \equivalent\ roentgens.,
      \Radiation\ is used in several ways, often causing confusion. It means a phenomenon that spreads in space (along a radius from the source, if you will), and there exist some quite different phenomena 
that do so. ,
      To a physicist, it often means \electromagnetic radiation\, an electric and magnetic disturbance spreading as a wave in space. See for instance    http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Sun5wave.htm(You might 
also need the section preceding it     http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Sun4spec.htm)    Depending on frequency, this covers radio, microwaves, light (also infra-red and ultra-violet), X rays and gamma rays. 
\Solar radiation\ is thus sunlight, at all wavelength. ,
      However, when people talk about \radioactive radiation\ or \radiation belts of the Earth\ they mean a stream of fast particles, electrons, ions or neutrons, which also spreads in space. Early researchers 
did not understand the difference and the name stuck. ,
      \Irradiance\ as I understand it means energy deposited per unit area. The Sun beams at Earth 1.36 kilowatt per square meter, the \solar constant.\ I think that is the irradiance due to sunlight, 
or would be if the atmosphere did not scatter some of it back, and if the receiving area is perpendicular to sunlight.,
     \Solar Terrestrial Radiation\ I have not heard before. Solar Terrestrial Physics is the term usually applied to the particles sent out by the Sun, the magnetic fields they are embedded in and the 
phenomena these produce near Earth (see my web site with home page  http://www.phy6.org/Education/Intro.html) ,
      In other words, the Sun sends us MORE than just electromagnetic radiation. I would think the term excludes the solar wind but includes higher energy stuff--see for instance \Birth of a Radiation 
Belt\ at the end of the above web site.  \Solar Extraterrestrial Radiation\ I cannot even guess.,
      The answer is probably o.\ Yes, the solar wind will exert a pressure on objects in interplanetary space, but I believe the pressureof sunlight, small as it is, is greater. It is very rarefied--about 
6 atoms per cubic centimeter at the Earth's orbit.  ,
       The solar wind does move ion tails in comets, not by colliding with them but by the magnetic field lines embedded in it--a collective effect, in which a large volume of the solar wind acts together. 
Dust tails however point in a slightly different direction, suggesting they are moved bysunlight pressure, and not by the solar wind. See  http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Saberr.htm,
       In 1985 German scientists of the AMPTE mission exploded a charge ofbarium in the solar wind. The ions of barium vapor were quickly ionized by sunlight, creating an \artificial comet\ of barium ions. 
The \comet\ cloud was then quickly captured by magnetic field lines embedded in the solar wind, which made it share the flow velocity of the solar wind.,
      What is the furthest recorded distance of the earth's magnetic tail, and hypothetically speaking, what would you speculate the actual maximized distance to be, if there were no spacecraft present 
to obtain data during the times of lowest possible solar wind conditions? During what exact part of the sun's cycle would this most likely occur, to obtain this maximized distance/length? Also with the 
same thought in mind, how many times its normal size would the magnetosphere bloom outwards towards the sun? What ideal factors would have to be present (in the solar system)  or together to create a condition 
that would contribute to a total maximization of the Earth's magnetotail and what would those speculated/theoretical distances be?,
      I've had strong interest in magnetic fields and tails for over 25 years. I have some theories (for which I keep to myself) concerning planetary magnetotails, but unfortunately there is not enough 
data on the Earth's magnetotail available. I may be totally unaware of new data that is available.Alex ,
      Presumably, you have read all my web pages on these matters in \Exploration of the Earth's Magnetosphere\ where such matters are discussed, and I will not repeat what was stated there. ,
       How far does the magnetotail extend? The answer depends on both physics and our use of language: at what point do we stop calling it \magnetotail\ and starting to call it \wake\? Plasma sheet field 
lines at IMP 8 (35 RE or Earth radii) are still firmly anchored at Earth, at both ends. However around 50-80 RE, the plasma starts streaming tailward, picking up the solar wind flow. The field lines are 
still terrestrial, but it's hard to say what shapes them further out. We have observations of ISEE-3 andGeotail to about 220 RE, and once long ago a spacecraft crossed the Earth-Sun line at about 1000 
RE and saw some disturbance.  ,
       We know less about the planets. With Jupiter, for a long time, space probes avoided the tail because, in order to pick extra up velocity from the planet (see \Stargazers\, sect. 35), they had to 
exit at 90 deg. to the sun-Jupiter line. More recently, \Galileo\ entered orbit around Jupiter and has done some observation. There exist some tentative observations of a drop-out of the solar wind, seen 
by a spacecraft near the orbit of Saturn, which might have come from the wake of Jupiter. ,
       The lowest possible solar wind effects occured May 11-12 1999, when the solar wind density near Earth dropped to 0.2 ions/cc (6  ions/cc is typical) and the dayside boundary of closed field lines 
in the Sun'sdirection, typically at 10.5 RE, retreated to 20-25 RE.,
      I am an Italian student of Physics and I met your very beautiful site http://www.phy6.org/earthmag/, and I have a question for you. I would like to know exactly the size of the magnetosphere, say 
from the Earth's surface up to the magnetopause, compressed in the day part and elongated into the magnetotail in the night part. ,
      The average distance to the dayside ose of the magnetosphere\(\subsolar point\ in phys-speak) is about 10.5 Earth radii or some 67,000kilometers. On the flanks, 90 degrees from there, the distance 
is about15 Earth radii, and ithe flanks continue to approach a cylinder, about 25Earth radii in radius.,
        At midnight there is no clear boundary. What happens, apparently, isthat past 50-80 Earth radii the solar wind infiltrates the magnetotail,so the material is mostly solar wind, but the magnetic 
field is stillthat of Earth. It goes like this for at least 220 Earth radii.,
       But mind you, these are averages. When the pressure of the solar windrises, the boundary moves inwards. It also does so if the interplanetarymagnetic field slants southward, which \erodes\ the magnetic 
field by areconnection process. A few times each year, therefore, the boundarypasses satellites in synchronous orbit, at 6.6 Earth radii. On the otherhand, in 1999 an instance occurred when the solar wind 
was veryrarefied, and the noon-side boundary went out past 20 Earth radii.,
      I see a satellite like device in geocentric orbit that has an electroncollecting apparatus, perhaps similar to a solar panel, on the sidefacing the sun.  These collected electrons would then be focused, 
andaccelerated via a solar powered anode and then aimed/directed byutilizing and or manipulating the lines of magnetic force generated bythe earth's core along with the magnetosphere. ,
      Once focused, accelerated, and directed,  the electron beam could thenbe \shot\ \Sky Illuminating Electron Gun\, or SIEG at the earth'satmosphere, creating a recognizable/predetermined image by strikingtargeted 
nitrogen and oxygen atoms at various altitudes; thus providingthe necessary primary colors along with a depth of field that wouldresult in the creation of a three dimensional/holographic image(s)turning 
the night sky into a rainbow of choreographed light-ballerinasdancing across the heavens.  Or perhaps a giant illuminated billboardfor advertisement purposes.  Do you too find it odd that one must dealwith 
the devil to get to heaven, or in your case, funding for research?  ,
      Your proposal sounds interesting--at the very least.  Still, I amgreatly relieved to be able to say that it will not work, for severalgood reasons. Even if it did, I may add, the field line structure 
of theEarth's magnetic field is such that the only people able to watch yourdisplay would be inhabitants of Alaska and northern Scandinavia, Russiaand Canada--not the audience to make such a project pay 
for itself commercially! ,
      If is possible to see ion's pass through a cloud chamber, and we know they are solid particles that contain energy, why can we not develop a way to capture that energy?  Truly using the power of 
the sun to generate electricity.,
      I have an idea!  If we were able to channel ions within a magnetic field with some kind of collector would this not generate electricity?  Possibly developing a type of electrical absorbing gel, 
that when the ions pass through, collects this energy and transmits it out. ,
   For those reasons and others, space vehicles prefer to use solar cellsto capture the energy of ordinary sunlight, a much more abundant source.On Earth, too, solar cells are the usual tool.,
       I was involved with the Virginia Governor's School of Math, Science,and Technology this past summer, in a class on SpacePhysics. I am using my knowledge in thiscourse to conduct a research project/ 
experimentation on Geomagneticstorms and their effect on short radio wave transmissions. I wasplanning on using an old radio (one my grandfather used to do his HAMradio sessions) and monitoring a singular 
radio station and observingthe relative clarity or disturbances during each observation. I wouldthen log onto the internet and check the levels of geomagnetic storms atwww.spaceweather.com. I would then 
compare my observations with thegeomagnetic activity and make a correlation between the two. (higheractivity causes more disturbance),
      However, after reading your email, I see that solar disturbances affectradio wave transmissions more so than Geomagnetic storms. I was justwondering if you could guide me in refining my procedure 
so I can obtainbetter results. As it is now, I am unsure my project will yield validresults. Any ideas on your part would be greatly appreciated. Would itbe more effective for me to change my project to 
measure the affect ofsolar disturbances (solar flares, coronal holes, CMEs) on short radiowave transmission, rather than geomagnetic storms? How can I compare andcorrelate the two variables if I do change?,

       All manned flights (except those of Apollo) have stayed below the radiationbelt: the Space Shuttle, for instance, orbits at about 215 miles. The atmosphere is very rarefied there, and radiation 
belt particles descending to that level may well come back without encounteringanything. However, such particles have thousands of Earthward excursions each day, so the only ones which are likely to survive 
long are those that are always confined to higher levels.,
       A more subtle effect is also at work. The equations governing themotion of trapped particle indicate that each has a characteristic valueof magnetic intensity, below which is cannot penetrate. Suppose 
aparticle is reflected by the intensity existing at 215 miles. As ithappens, the Earth's magnetic field--its region of magnetic forces--hassome irregularities, so in some regions that intensity is only 
reachedat 100 miles. Now and then the particle's orbit will happen to descend in thatregion, where it penetrates to much deeper (and denser) layers of theatmosphere, and may be quickly lost, even if elsewhere 
it stays at safeheights. One such notorious region exists above the southern Atlantic Ocean.,
        So the radiation belt does not reach the levels where Mercury, Gemini,Soyuz and Mir used to orbit and where the Shuttle and Space Station doso now. The early Russian Sputniks failed to discover 
the radiation beltbecause they too stayed in such low orbits and  Explorers 1 and 3 only detected it because they were rather poorly controlled and rose above 1500 miles.   ,
     My question, then, is: will a magnetic field of sufficient strength repel non-charged particles or would they have to have to be electrons or ions with a charge to be affected? Could a magnetic field 
deflect say, a hydrogen atom or a helium atom that has the proper amount of electrons to be neutrally charged? And, while we're at it, would the field have to be stronger to deflect bigger particles, say 
something the size of a grain of sand or a pebble?,
     I am afraid the answer is no--magnetic fields have no effect on uncharged dust or pebbles. Have you ever had an occasion to be examined on an MRI machine? (MRI is Magnetic Resonance Imaging--it used 
to be called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, but the word uclear\ frightened too many people, who did not realize the nuclei in question were  stable well-behaved nuclei of hydrogen). You lie still on a pallet 
which rolls your body until the part being imaged is inside a big doughnut shaped magnet. That magnet is so strong that the attendant will collect from you anything that has iron in it--key chains etc.--lest 
it is snatched from you and flung towards the machine. Yet when you lie inside it (it makes an infernal racket, by the way) you cannot sense any special magnetic forces on your uncharged body.,
       Even for shielding yourself from fast ions and electrons in space, it would be hard to create a magnetic field strong enough and extensive enough. For a spaceship moving at c/3, though, shielding 
is not that hard--all the stuff coming at it moves essentially in one direction, so one only has to provide some armor on the front side. A very, very thick armor, maybe, but only right in front, no need 
to cover space all around.,
        Fly at c/3, you say. How are your brave astronauts going to achieve that? And how will they stop again once they reach their destination? As far as I know, the only person to address this without 
defying known laws of physics was Robert Forward\ in \The Flight of the Dragonfly\ (details there, in the appendix). His scheme is still far-far out, requiring incredible resources, but it is not impossible.,

     What matters most is \where,\ or as they say in the real estatebusiness--location, location, location. Your best bet is Fairbanks,Alaska; you may also see northern lights in Winnipeg, Canada, or evenInternational 
Falls, Minnesota, but they could only be near the northernhorizon.,
       Scientists call the phenomenon the \polar aurora.\ Earlier it wasnamed \aurora borealis\ meaning orthern dawn\ in Latin, since inEurope it was mostly seen as a glow near the northern horizon. However,it 
also occurs near the south pole, so \polar aurora\ is now preferred.Aurora is caused by electrons energized in the Earth's magneticenvironment, the magnetosphere, and guided earthward along magneticfield 
lines (lines of force) along which they slide, a bit like beadssliding along a wire. They move at about 1/5 the speed of light and inmany ways they resemble electrons beamed at the screen inside thepicture 
tube of a TV receiver. Where picture-tube electrons producelight when they hit the screen, auroral electrons do so when they hitthe fringes of the atmosphere, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) up.,
        The field lines on which this happens are the ones coming down alonga circle centered near the magnetic pole (\auroral circle\ or \auroraloval\), and that is where the accelerated electrons end 
up. The circlecan expand and contract, but it usually passes near Fairbanks.,
       When? Don't expect to see aurora in the Alaskan tourist season, duringthe summer, it just does not get dark enough. Just as near-polar winternights are long and dark, summer days are long and bright, 
and evenafter the Sun sets, twilight persists.  September has some darkness,October much more--March and April are also OK, and so is winter, if youdo not mind the cold. When? The brightest auroras come 
from the nightside of the magnetosphere, so you should see them around midnight, orlater because of Alaska's time zone. If you stay in a hotel, ask thedesk clerk to wake you when a good display occurs.,

       What about the 11-year sunspot cycle? Occasionally, but especially inyears of peak sunspot activity, the Sun sends out blobs of hot gas,which hit the magnetosphere and agitate it, causing \magnetic 
storms.\At such times the \auroral circle\ expands and reaches the lower 48states of the US and mid-latitude Europe. The agitation also producesfine auroras, as happened on 5 November 2001, when the US 
was favorablylocated. However, since Fairbanks is located near the normal auroralcircle, auroras are observed there throughout the 11-year cycle. Themain factor is the slanting of interplanetary magnetic 
field lines(which come from the Sun)--southward slant, auroras likely, northwardslant, not so much. That slant varies randomly, though satellitesmonitor it, and you can read their latest reports on the 
web.,
       You find much more in the various chapters and links of \TheExploration of the Earth's Magnetosphere\,http://www.phy6.org/Education/Intro.html. That collection includessections on the aurora, magnetic 
field lines, the event of 5 November2001 and one about \space weather,\ with links telling where to findpredictions of the likelihood of aurora.,
     Kind of hard to work on a house when the foundation is shaky, no?  Your teachers and your texts should really answer those questions, but let me try, anyway. ,
       How do you measure time? A good \clock\ is the rotation of the Earth, and in early times this was checked by the position of the Sun. When the Sun was highest above the horizon--and exactly to the 
south--the time was noon, and the interval from one noon to the next was a DAY, or more precisely a solar day.,
       Universal Time is essentially the time in Greenwich, England, and serves as reference time for astronomical events (e.g. the observed onset of the 1987 supernova). It's sort of a \world time\ not 
tied to any local clock. There exists a small correction, but if the above is good enough for you, you may skip the next 2 paragraphs.----------------------------------------,
       But measuring time in mean solar days is not all. One must also decide when each day begins! Astronomers have agreed that each mean day begins with (mean) midnight at the Royal Astronomical Observatory 
in Greenwich, England, and time defined that way is known as UNIVERSAL TIME (UT). \Greenwich Mean Time\ (GMT) is similar, but is counted from noon.] ,
        So, UNIVERSAL TIME essentially measures time, using the rotation of the Earth around its axis. LOCAL TIME (LT), on the other hand, measures not time but position relative to the Sun.,
     Suppose you cover the Earth with a network of lines of latitude and longitude     (see on the web  http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Slatlong.htm  )The at UT=0 it is midnight in Greenwich, 11 am in Russia, 
6 pm in the Eastern US, and so forth; these are the LOCAL TIMES at these locations. Three hours later you add 3 hours to all these local times--and so forth, for other locations and other times. The local 
time at each location depends on the difference between its longitude (\meridian\)  and the longitude where it happens to be midnight. (You need not use time zones, but take the exact difference in longitude, 
for exact local time.)  Your local time is 12 noon if your location faces the Sun, LT=24 (midnight) if it faces away from the Sun, and other values of LT  for other relative positions of the Sun.,
       One can similarly cover the Earth with lines of MAGNETIC LATITUDE and LONGITUDE, the latter converging not at the geographic poles but at the magnetic poles. As the globe rotates, we can say as 
before that all points on the same magnetic longitude have a certain MAGNETIC LOCAL TIME (MLT).  We have MLT=12 (noon) on the magnetic meridian (magnetic line of longitude) facing the Sun, and MLT=0 (or 
24) on the meridian facing the opposite direction, and so on,. It is completely similar to ordinary LT.,
       Why is MLT important? Because the shape of the magnetic environment of the Earth--the magnetosphere--is determined by the solar wind, which \blows\ almost exactly from the sun. So at MLT=12 a point 
faces in the\upwind\ direction, and at MLT=24 in the \downwind\ direction. Phenomena related to the action of the solar wind on the Earth's magnetic field, such as the polar aurora or daily magnetic variations, 
depend very much on MLT.,
     First, our atmosphere is electrically neutral and does not conduct electricity (below 50 km, anyway--and weather stays below 10-20 km). Substances of this kind (except maybe permanent magnet, a very 
special case) do not react to magnetic fields. When a doctor puts your body inside the strong magnet of an MRI machine, you feel no difference, except maybe for the loud noise that machine makes.,
       Second, weather gets its energy from heat deposited by sunlight on the surface of Earth.  The energy of the magnetosphere, on the other hand, comes from the solar wind. A beam of the solar wind 
as wide as the magnetosphere carries only about 1/3500 as much energy as sunlight hitting Earth, and only about 1% of that is given to the magnetosphere. Of that, only a fraction reaches the upper atmosphere. 
It seems too little to make a difference, and it is not clear how it might move further down.,
       Practically all that energy, by the way, is channeled to the auroral zone, near the poles. As was said--no clear correlation has been observed, there or elsewhere. You may not get a scientist to 
say \absolutely no,\ but \very unlikely\ may be just as good.,
   Clicking on any of the items below moves the cursor to the appropriate definition in the glossary. Many listings in the glossary are also clickable, linked to the section of \Exploration\ where they 
are discussed or used. Clickable words in the definitions are usually linked to related glossary items. ,
   Adiabatic invariant--An invariant of a motion is a quantity which does not change as time advances. For instance, the energy of a system is often an invariant (for a swinging pendulum, or a planet and 
the Sun), and knowing that it stays constant is a great help in calculating the motion.     Adiabatic invariants are quantities associated with approximately periodic motions. They almost do not change, 
and thus also help in calculating the motion, to a very good degree of accuracy. They are often important in calculating the way ions and electrons move in a magnetic field.,
   Alpha particle--A type of fast ion emitted by many types of heavy radioactive nuclei, such as uranium. Actually, the nucleus (atom stripped of all electrons) of the gas helium. ,
 Aurora (short for polar aurora)--A glow in the sky, often observed in a ring-shaped region around the magnetic poles (\auroral zone\) and occasionally further equatorward. The name comes from an older 
one, \aurora borealis,\ Latin for orthern dawn,\ given because an aurora near the northern horizon (its usual location when seen in most of Europe) looks like the glow of the sky preceding sunrise. Also 
known as orthern lights,\ although it occurs both north and south of the equator.    The aurora is generally caused by fast electrons from space, guided earthward by magnetic field lines, and its light 
comes from collisions between such electrons and the atoms of the upper atmosphere, typically 100 km (60 miles) above ground. ,
   Auroral acceleration--The process by which auroral electrons acquire their energies, typically 1-10 keV. May be associated with parallel voltage drops or with an interaction between particles and plasma 
waves, and may be related to magnetic reconnection in the plasma sheet. ,
  Auroral kilometric radiation--intense radio waves whose wavelength is of the order of a kilometer, emitted from regions above the ionosphere where the aurora is (apparently) accelerated. Since the waves 
are even longer than those of the AM radio band, they are stopped by the ionosphere and do not reach the ground, but they are readily observed from spacecraft. ,
   Auroral oval--the region in which aurora appears at the same time, corresponding to the \ring of fire\ around the magnetic pole, often observed by satellite cameras.  It resembles a circle centered 
a few hundred kilometers nightward of the magnetic pole, and its size varies with magnetic activity. During large magnetic storms it expands greatly, making auroras visible at regions far from the pole, 
where they are a rare occurence. ,
   Auroral zone--the region on Earth where auroras are common--a smeared-out average (over time and distance from the magnetic pole) of the auroral oval. Typical magnetic latitude is 63-65 degrees. ,
 Barium release--the firing from a rocket or spacecraft above the atmosphere of a charge of barium, evaporated by a thermite process. Usually produced shortly after sunset, when the sky  is already dark 
but sunlight still reaches the high altitude where the release occurs. The  barium atoms are released as a vapor, they spread rapidly and are readily ionized by sunlight. The ion cloud then moves with 
the local plasma and is therefore a useful tracer of plasma flows. ,
 Birkeland currents--electric currents linking the Earth´s ionosphere with more distant regions, flowing along magnetic field lines. Named for Kristian Birkeland, a pioneer of auroral research who first 
proposed such currents around 1900, these currents are often associated with the polar aurora and with substorms.,
 Boundary layer--a transition layer between two neighboring regions in the magnetosphere. The plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL) is the transition from the plasma sheet and the tail lobes. The low latitude 
boundary layer (LLBL),  just inside the magnetopause, is the transition between the equatorial magnetosphere and the solar wind (more accurately, the magnetosheath, solar wind slowed down by passage through 
the bow shock). ,
 Bow shock--a sharp front formed in the solar wind ahead of the magnetosphere, marked by a sudden slowing-down of the flow near Earth.  It is quite similar to the shock forming ahead of the wing of a supersonic 
airplane. After passing near Earth, the slowed-down flow gains speed again, to the same value as the surrounding solar wind. ,
 Convection (magnetospheric)--large-scale plasma flow, circulating in the magnetosphere and driven by the solar wind. Plasma physics requires such circulation to be associated with an electric field. Assuming 
that the electric field propagates along magnetic field lines (as it would along good conductors of electricity) and reaches the polar ionosphere, corresponding electric fields should be observed above 
the polar caps, and such fields exist.    In the view proposed in 1961 by Axford and Hines, plasma near the flanks is dragged tailwards by the adjoining solar wind flow, through the action of \viscous-like 
forces\; in the view suggested that same year by Dungey, plasma travels tailward on \open\ field lines following reconnection. Evidence suggests both processes contribute. In both models the plasma returns 
earthward in the plasma sheet near midnight, a process which could be not continuous but intermittent, associated with substorms.,
 Coronal mass ejection (CME)--a huge cloud of hot plasma, occasionally expelled from the Sun. It may accelerate ions and electrons and may travel through interplanetary space as far as the Earth´s orbit 
and beyond it, often preceded by a shock front.  When the shock reaches Earth, a magnetic storm may result. ,
 Cosmic rays--A steady drizzle of high energy ions arriving at the solar system from the distant universe. Their energies are enormous, ranging from 1-2 billion electron volts to perhaps 100,000,000 that 
much, though the higher energies are rare. Their total energy flow is comparable to that starlight. The origin of their huge energies is uncertain, but may come from expanding shock fronts created by supernova 
explosions.,
 Crab nebula--a cloud-like nebula observed in the Crab constellation, the remnant of a supernova explosion observed in China in 1054. It contains a very rapidly rotating (and hence, young) pulsar, which 
is probably the remnant of the supernova.  The emissions of radio waves and light from this nebula suggest the presence of high energy particles.,
 Cusps (of the magnetosphere)--two regions of weak magnetic field, on the sunward boundary of the magnetosphere, one on each side of the equator. They separate magnetic field lines closing on the front 
from those swept into the Earth´s  magnetotail.,
 Dipole--a compact source of magnetic force, with two magnetic poles. A bar magnet, coil or current loop, if their size is small, create a dipole field. The Earth´s field, as a crude approximation, also 
resembles that of a dipole, located near the Earth´s center. ,
 Drift--A magnetically trapped ion or electron moves as if it were attached to a magnetic field line.  Drift is one of the features of such motion, namely its slow shift from one guiding field line to 
its neighbor. In the Earth´s magnetic field, such drifts gradually move particles all the way around Earth. Viewed from far above the north magnetic pole, ions drift around the Earth clockwise, electrons 
counter-clockwise, resulting in an electric current circling the Earth, the ring current.,
 Dynamo process--the generation of an electric currents by the flow of an electrically conducting fluid through a magnetic field. For instance, the magnetic field originating inside the Earth is believed 
to come from a dynamo process involving the flow of molten iron in the Earth´s hot core. The energy required to create the current is obtained from the motion of the flow. ,
 Earth radius (RE)--the average radius of the Earth, a convenient unit of distance in describing phenomena and orbits in the Earth´s neighborhood in space. 1 RE = 6371 km = 3960 miles, approximately. ,

 Edison effect--the flow of an electric current  through a laboratory vacuum, between two metal wires, one of which is heated. The current flows only when the heated wire is more negative, because it is 
due to free electrons released from the wire by heat. The Edison effect made possible \vacuum tubes\ used in radio and television equipment before the invention of the transistor. ,
 Electric charge--that which causes electrons and ions to attract each other, and to repel particles of the same kind. The electric charge of electrons is called egative\ (-) and that of ions \positive\ 
(+). Materials such as glass, fur and cloth acquire an electric charge by rubbing against each other, a process which tears electrons off one substance and attaches it to the other.  Electric charges (+) 
and (-) may also be separated by a chemical process, as in an electric battery. About Ben Franklin's role in studying and naming electrical charges, click here. ,
 Electric current--a continuous flow of electrons and/or ions, through a material with conducts electricity. A currents usually flows in a closed circuit, without beginning or end. In daily life currents 
are generally driven through wires by voltages produced by batteries or generators. In space plasmas, some currents may be produced this way, but many are inherent to the way ions and electrons move through 
magnetic fields, e.g. their drifts. ,
 Electric field--the region in which electric forces can be observed, e.g. near an electric charge. As a field, it may also be viewed as a region of space modified by the presence of electric charges. 
,
 Electrojets, auroral--two intense electric currents, flowing around the auroral oval from the day side towards the night side and meeting somewhat west of midnight. Associated with Birkeland currents 
and caused by the unusual electric conductivity properties of ionospheric plasma, the electrojets are responsible for practically all of the magnetic disturbance observed on the ground due to substorms. 
Their magnitude (derived by analyzing such disturbances) often serves as a convenient gauge of the intensity of substorm activity. ,
 Electromagnet--a magnet powered by an electric current. Usually the current flows in a coil, which may or may not contain a core of iron or of some other magnetic material. ,
 Electromagnetic field (EM field)--the regions of space near electric currents, magnets, broadcasting antennas etc., regions in which electric and magnetic forces may act. Generally the EM field is regarded 
as a modification of space itself, enabling it to store and transmit energy. ,
 Electromagnetic wave--a combination of oscillating magnetic and electric field, spreading in wavelike fashion through space at a speed of about 300 000 km.sec. James Clerk Maxwell´s theory in 1864 suggested 
that light was such a wave, and today we know that such waves include all forms of light--also infra-red and ultra-violet, as well as radio waves, microwaves, x-rays and gamma rays. ,
 Electron--a lightweight particle, carrying a negative electric charge and found in all atoms. Electrons can be energized or even torn from atoms by light and by collisions, and they are responsible for 
many electric phenomena in solid matter and in plasmas. (About the discovery of the electron in 1897, click here.,
 Electron volt (ev)--a convenient unit of energy applied to ions and electrons, equal to the energy gains when such particles \fall\ across a voltage difference of 1 volt. Gas molecules at room temperature 
have about 0.03 ev, on the Sun´s face about 0.6 ev, typical electrons of the aurora 5000 ev, typical protons in the inner radiation belt 20,000,000 ev, typical cosmic ray protons near Earth 10,000,000,000 
ev, and the highest energies of cosmic rays may reach up to 10,000,000,000 times more. ,
 Electroscope--a simple instrument, indicating the presence of electric charge by the spreading-apart of two leaves of metal foil, hanging next to each other inside a glass jar. The rate at which an electroscope 
in dry air loses its charge is a rough indicator of the prevailing level of ionizing radiation. ,
 Energetic particles--charged atomic particles moving rapidly, often at a significant fraction of the speed of light. They can penetrate matter, ionize the material which they traverse and emit energetic 
photons (e.g. of x-rays). See also radiation belt, cosmic rays, solar energetic particles.,
 Energy--loosely, anything that can cause a machine to move. For example, energy is contained in moving water, water raised to a high place, heat or  magnetic fields. The energy of fast ions and electrons 
(measured in \ electron volts\) is a measure of their speed, and it enables them (for instance) to penetrate matter. ,
 Explorer 1--first satellite launched by the US, around midnight of January 31, 1958. Carrying Geiger counters, Expolorer 1 and the similar Explorer 3 (launched two months later) discovered the existence 
of a belt of magnetically trapped energetic particles around Earth. ,
 Field line preservation--a property of fluids which are perfect conductors of electricity (including \ideal plasmas\), by which two particles which initially share the same field line, continue to do 
so into the future. The opposite also holds for such fluids: two particles which start out on different field lines will always be on different field lines. ,
 Frequency--the number of back-and-forth cycles per second, in a wave or wave-like process. Expressed this way, the frequency is said to be given in units of Hertz (Hz), named after the scientist who first 
produced and observed radio waves in the lab. Alternating current in homes in the US goes through 60 cycles each second, hence its frequency is 60 Hz; in Europe it is 50 cycles and 50 Hz. ,
  Geiger counter--a simple electronic detector of energetic particles. It consists of a thin straight wire at a high positive voltage (usually close to 1000 volts) relative to a cylindrical electrode surrounding 
it. Geiger counters can detect (\count\) high-energy particles, but they cannot identify their type or distinguish their energy. ,
 Geocorona--the outermost layer of the Earth´s neutral atmosphere, a huge cloud of hydrogen surrounding our planet. Its density diminishes with distance and it has been observed up to distances of 5-6 
Earth radii. ,
 GSM coordinates--geocentric solar magnetospheric coordinates, the system in which locations in the large-scale magnetosphere are usually given. The main axis (oon-midnight\) points at the Sun, and the 
plane of symmetry (oon-mignight plane\) contains the Earth´s magnetic axis, which however needs not be exactly perpendicular to the sunward direction.,
 Guiding center--An ion and electron in a magnetic field, of suitably low energy, is constrained to circle (\gyrate\) around a local magnetic field line, while the center of its circular motion slides 
up or down along the line and also slowly shifts from one guiding field line to its neighbor, following certain rules. The center of that circle is known as the particle´s guiding center and the entire 
mode of mottion is called guiding center motion. See gyration, magnetic mirroring,  drift.,
 IMF polarity--the general direction of interplanetary magnetic field lines in  a certain location (e.g. near Earth), i.e. whether they head away from the Sun (\away polarity\) or towards it (owards polarity\). 
The IMF polarity determines which of the polar caps of the Earth is magnetically linked to the Sun and gets polar rain guided towards it. See interplanetary sector.,
 Inner magnetosphere--the region of the magnetosphere in which ions and electrons are relatively stably trapped. Approximately the region threaded by field lines which cross the equator within synchronous 
orbit, i.e. within 6.6 Earth radii.,
 Interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)--the weak magnetic field filling interplanetary space, with field lines usually connected to the Sun. The IMF is kept out of most of the Earth´s magnetosphere, but 
the interaction of the two plays a major role in the flow of energy from the solar wind to the Earth´s environment. ,
 Interplanetary shock--the abrupt boundary formed at the front of a  plasma cloud (e.g. one from a coronal mass ejection) if it pushes its way through interplanetary space much faster than the rest of 
the solar wind. See bow shock. For an article about the impact of a large shock on the magnetosphere, click here.,
 Interplanetary sector--a region of interplanetary space in which all magnetic field lines point either away from the Sun (\away sector\) or towards the Sun (owards sector\). The Earth´s orbit typically 
contains 4 sectors, but 2 or 6 are not unusual; they are caused by waviness of the current sheet separating magnetic field lines from opposite polar regions of the Sun. ,
 Ion--usually, an atom from which one or more electrons have been torn off, leaving a positively charged particle. \Negative ions\ are atoms which have acquired one or more extra electrons, and clusters 
of atoms can also become ions. ,
 Ionic Theory--in chemistry, the theory (by Svante Arrhenius, 1884) which first explained the behavior of acids, alkalis (bases) and salts when dissolved in water. By the ionic theory, each molecule of 
such materials consists of molecular or atomic groupings charged with positive or negative electricity (\ions\), held together by their mutual electrical attraction. In water these electrical forces are 
greatly weakened, the groupings often get separated, and if an electric current flows, positive and negative ones migrate with it in opposite directions. ,
 Ionization--the process by which a neutral atom, or a cluster of such atoms, becomes an ion. This may occur, for instance, by absorbtion of light (\photoionization\) or by a collision with a fast particle 
(\impact ionization\). Also, certain molecules (such as table salt or sodium chloride, NaCl) are formed by natural ions (like Na+ and Cl-) held together by their electric attraction, and they may fall 
apart when dissolved in water (which weakens the attraction), enabling the solution to conduct electricity. ,
 Ionosphere--a region covering the highest layers in the Earth´s atmosphere, containing an appreciable population of ions and free electrons. The ions are created by sunlight ranging from the ultra-violet 
to x-rays. In the lowest and least rarefied layer of the ionosphere, the D-layer (around 70 km or 45 miles), as soon as the Sun sets the ions and electrons recombine, but in the higher layers, collisions 
are so few that its ion layers last throughout the night,
 Lagrangian point--in a system dominated by two attracting bodies (such as Sun and Earth), a point at which a third, much smaller body (such as a satellite) keeps the same position relative to the other 
two. Theoretically, the Sun-Earth system has 5 Lagrangian points, but only two are important: L1 (L-one), on the sunward side of Earth, about 4 times the distance of the Moon, and L2 at approximately the 
same distance on the midnight side. ,
 Magnetic field lines--lines in space, used for visually representing magnetic fields.  At any point in space, the local field line points in the direction of the magnetic force which an isolated magnetic 
pole at that point would experience. In a plasma, magnetic field lines also guide the motion of ions and electrons, and direct the flow of some electric currents.,
 Magnetic latitude--geographic latitude of a location, in a system of latitudes and longitudes whose axis is not the rotation axis of the Earth but the magnetic axis, i.e. the axis of the dipole at the 
Earth´s center which best fits the internal magnetic field. The auroral zone, for instance, is near magnetic latitude 65 degrees. See magnetic local time.,
  Magnetic local time (MLT)--in the a system of latitude and longitude whose axis is the dipole axis, magnetic local time is the longitude,  measured not in degrees but in hours (1 hour = 15 degrees). 
   The zero of this longitude is not fixed relative to Earth (the way the Greenwhich meridian is for geographic longitude), but rather relative to the Sun: the line of magnetic longitude facing the Sun 
always has MLT = 12 hours (\magnetic noon\), and the opposite one has MLT = 0 or 24 hours (\magnetic midnight\). See magnetic latitude,
 Magnetic mirroring--the process by which an ion or electron, constrained by its guiding center motion to follow a magnetic fields line, slows its advance down that line as it enters a region of stronger 
magnetic field, and is ultimately turned back (\mirrors\) at a certain \mirror point.\      Mirroring is what makes possible long-term trapping of ions and electrons in the Earth´s radiation belts. In 
the inner magnetosphere, ions and electrons are confined between two mirror points, one north of the equator and one south of it. These turn them back before their motion along the guiding field line reaches 
the atmosphere, where they might otherwise have been lost by colliding with molecules of air. ,
 Magnetometer--intrument for measuring magnetic fields. Spacecraft often carry fluxgate magnetometers, which measure components of the magnetic field (3 of them are combined to give its strength and direction) 
but need to be calibrated. Rubidium-vapor and similar instruments measure only the strength, but their reading is absolute, related to atomic constants. ,
 Magnetic reconnection--In a plasma, the process by which plasma particles riding along two different field lines can be made to share the same field line (see field line preservation). For instance, following 
reconnection, solar wind particles on an interplanetary field line, and magnetospheric ones on a field line attached to Earth, may find themselves sharing the same \open\ field line, which has one end 
anchored on Earth and the other extending to distant space.    Magnetic reconnection can occur when plasma flows through a neutral point or a neutral line at which the intensity of the magnetic field is 
zero and its direction is not defined. It is an important concept in the theories of energy transfer from the solar wind to the magnetosphere and of energy release in substorms. ,
 Magnetic storm--A large-scale disturbance of the magnetosphere, often initiated by the arrival of an interplanetary shock originating at the Sun.      A magnetic storm is marked by the injection of an 
appreciable number of ions from the magnetotail into the ring current, a process accompanied by increased auroral displays. The strengthened ring current causes a world-wide drop in the equatorial magnetic 
field, taking perhaps 12 hours to reach its greatest intensity, followed by a more gradual recovery. ,
 Magnetometer--an instrument for measuring magnetic fields. Spacecraft often carry fluxgate magnetometers, which measure components of the magnetic field (3 of them are combined to give its strength and 
direction) but they need to be calibrated.    Rubidium-vapor and similar instruments measure only the field strength, but their reading is absolute, related to atomic constants. ,
 Magnetosheath--the region between the magnetopause and the bow shock, containing solar wind which has been slowed down by passage through the bow shock. As the magnetosheath plasma streams away from the 
bow shock, it gradually regains its former velocity.,
 Magnetotail--The long stretched-out nightside of the magnetosphere, the region in which substorms begin. It starts about 8 Earth radii (RE) nightward of the Earth and has been observed to distances of 
at least 220 RE. See plasma sheet, tail lobes, ,
  Neutral line (NL)--A line along which the magnetic intensity is zero. Like a neutral point, a NL can play an central role in magnetic reconnection, but because of physical reasons, it may be a more likely 
setting for the actual reconnection process. ,
 Neutral line, distant--A neutral line in the distant magnetotail where (by Dungey´s theory) interplanetary field lines which were split apart by magnetic reconnection when they first encountered the magnetosphere 
are once more re-united.    There is little doubt such re-uniting takes place: what is unclear is the exact manner in which it happens. ,
 Photon--colloquially, a \particle of light.\ Although light spreads as an electromagnetic wave, it can be created or absorbed only in discrete amounts of energy, known as photons. The energy of a photon 
is greater the shorter the wavelength--smallest for radio waves, larger for visible light, largest for x-rays and gamma rays.,
 Photosphere--The layer of the Sun from which all visible light reaches us. The Sun is too hot to have a solid surface and the photosphere consists of a plasma at about 6000 degrees centigrade. ,
 Planetary magnetospheres--the magnetospheres of planets, especially of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, all of which have dipole-like magnetic fields stronger than the Earth´s. Mercury has a weak 
magnetic field, Mars and the Moon are magnetized in patches (probably on their surfaces) and Venus, although non-magnetic, has its own interaction with the solar wind, by means of its thick ionosphere.,

 Plasma --a gas containing free ions and electrons, and therefore capable of conducting electric currents. A \partially ionized plasma\ such as the Earth´s ionosphere is one that also contains neutral 
atoms. ,
 Plasma physics--the study of plasma phenomena--in the laboratory, where it may one day help extract energy from hydrogen fusion, in the Sun and the distant universe, in the Earth´s ionosphere and in the 
magnetospheres of Earth and other planets. ,
 Plasma sheet--a near-equatorial layer of denser plasma in the tail of the Earth´s magnetosphere. It separates the two tail lobes, the two bundles of magnetic field lines connected to the regions around 
the Earth´s magnetic poles. ,
 Plasmasphere--A region of relatively dense but cool plasma, surrounding Earth, extending to distances of about 5 Earth radii (RE). The plasmasphere is the upward extension of the Earth´s ionosphere, getting 
less and less dense with increasing distance, and it shares the Earth´s rotation. ,
 Polar caps--in magnetospheric usage, the regions around the Earth´s magnetic poles, inside the auroral oval. The field lines in these regions extend into the tail lobes of the Earth; they reach great 
distances and do not close in the magnetosphere. ,
 Polar rain--a drizzle of electrons observed inside the polar caps, apparently from the high end of the energy distribution of solar wind electrons. Its origin in the solar corona is revealed by the fact 
that in general only one polar cap receives it at any time--the one which (depending on IMF polarity) is linked to the Sun. ,
  Radioactivity--Instability of some atomic nuclei, causing them to change spontaneously to a lower energy level or to modify the number of protons and neutrons they contain. The 3 \classical\ types of 
radioactive emissions are (1) alpha particles, nuclei of helium (2) beta-rays, fast electrons and (3) gamma-rays, high-energy photons. ,
 Shock--A sudden transition at the front of fast flow of plasma or gas, when that flow moves too fast for the undisturbed gas to move out of its way. Also occurs when a steady fast flow hits an obstacle. 
,
 Solar corona--the outermost layer of the Sun´s atmosphere, visible to the eye during a total solar eclipse; it can also be observed through special filters and best of all, by X-ray cameras aboard satellites. 
The corona is very hot, up to 1-1.5 million degrees centigrade, and is the source of the solar wind,
 Solar energetic particles--high energy particles occasionally emitted from active areas on the Sun, associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The Earth´s magnetic field  keeps them out 
of regions close to Earth (except for the polar caps) but they can pose a hazard to space travelers far from Earth. ,
 Solar flare--a rapid outburst on the Sun, usually in the vicinity of active sunspots. A sudden brightening (only rarely seen without special filters) may be followed by the signatures of particle acceleration 
to high energies--x-rays, radio noise and often, a bit later, the arrival of high-energy ions from the Sun. ,
 Substorm--a process by which plasma in the magnetotail becomes energized at a fast rate, flowing earthward and producing bright auroras and large Birkeland currents, for typical durations of half an hour. 
,
 Sun--the star at the center of our solar system. The Sun keeps Earth warm and sustains life on it, and it also emits the solar wind and occasional bursts of solar energetic particles.,
 Sunspot--An intensely magnetic area on the Sun´s visible face. For unclear reasons, it is slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere (perhaps because the magnetic field somehow interferes with the 
outflow of solar heat in that region) and therefore appears a bit darker. Sunspots tend to be associated with violent solar outbursts of various kinds. ,
 Sunspot cycle  (or solar cycle)--an irregular cycle, averaging about 11 years in length, during which the  number of sunspots (and of their associated outbursts) rises and then drops again. Like the sunspots, 
the cycle is probably magnetic in nature, and the polar magnetic field of the Sun also reverses each solar cycle. ,
 Sun-synchronous orbit --a near-Earth orbit resembling that of a polar satellite, but inclined to it by a small angle.  With an appropriate value for the inclination angle, the equatorial bulge causes 
the orbit to rotate during the year once around the polar axis. Such a satellite then maintains a fixed position relative to the Sun and can, for instance, avoid entering the Earth´s shadow. ,
 Supernova--a large explosion at the end of the evolutionary process of many stars. (Strictly speaking, all that follows applies to a ype II\ supernova.)    A star such as the Sun is kept \puffed up\ to 
its apparent size by the heat which nuclear reactions create in its core. Once its nuclear fuel is used up, the pull of gravity overcomes all other forces and makes the star contract to a very small size. 
The star´s atoms or even its nuclei are then crushed, and the process may turn it into a pulsar or black hole.   An enormous amount of energy is released in this last collapse, blowing off the star´s outer 
layers as a rapidly expanding cloud of gas. It is widely believed that powerful shock fronts form ahead of this cloud´s advance, and through them some ions get accelerated to the very high energies of 
cosmic rays. ,
 Synchronous orbit --a circular orbit around the Earth´s equator, at a distance of 6.6 Earth radii. At this distance the orbital period is 24 hours, keeping the satellite \anchored\ above the same spot 
on Earth. This feature makes the synchronous orbit useful for communication satellites: a satellite transmitting TV programs to the US, for instance, will always be in touch with the US if \anchored\ above 
it, and receiving antennas on the ground only need to point to one fixed spot in the sky. ,
 Tail lobes--the two bundles of nearly-parallel magnetic field lines which stretch into the magnetotail, on opposite sides of the plasma sheet. The northern lobe contains field lines entering the north 
polar region of Earth, while the southern lobe contains lines emerging from the southern polar region. ,
 Tether, space--an experiment in which a satellite was released from the space shuttle at the end of a long insulated cable. The plan was for the  dynamo process due to the motion of the tether through 
the Earth´s magnetic field to generate a large current in the cable. ,
 Ultraviolet (UV)--electromagnetic radiation resembling visible light, but of shorter wavelength.  UV cannot be seen by the eye, and much of it is absorbed by ozone, a variant of oxygen, at altitudes of 
30-40 km. Satellite telescopes, however, can and do view stars and the Sun in UV, and even in the extreme UV (EUV), the range between UV and X-rays.,
 Vector--a physical quantity having both magnitude (= strength or intensity) and direction. The magnetic field observed at any point in space is a vector; other examples are velocity, acceleration, force 
and the electric field, which maps the electric force acting on ions and electrons. Equations involving vectors tend to be more complicated, as they have to describe three-dimensional structure. ,
 Voltage--a sort of \electric pressure,\ gauging the electric force acting on ions or electrons (or more accurately, the amount of energy they might obtain from that force). In electric devices such as 
are used in the home, increasing the voltage increases the current--just as increasing the pressure driving water through a pipe increases its flow rate. (The scientific term is \potential\ or \potential 
difference\.) ,
  X-rays--electromagnetic waves of short wavelength, capable of penetrating some thickness of matter. Medical x-rays are produced by letting a stream of fast electrons come to a sudden stop at a metal 
plate; it is believed that X-rays emitted by the Sun or stars also come from fast electrons.,
       An electrical storm--one which produces lightning--essentially requires a separated electric charge: negative charge (extra electrons) in one part of the cloud, positive charge in another. This 
process (discussed in section 18d of \From Stargazers to Starships\) involves static electric charges and no magnetism.,
       Magnetism requires electric currents, that is, not just positive and negative charges, but those charges must MOVE in opposite directions. In fact, they need not be separated: in space and in most 
conductors of electric current, any volume contains equal amounts of positive and negative charge. It is just that positive charges move one way (or in a metal, stay fixed), negative ones move the other 
way.  That gives current, which produce magnetic fields.  ,
       \Electromagnetic\ fields exist in such devices as electric transformer.  There you find a coil which carries an alternating current, and since it is wrapped around an iron core, that creates an 
alternating magnetic field in the iron.  By Faraday's law of induction, THAT produces an alternating ELECTRIC field in the space around the iron. If you then put a \secondary\ coil in that space, it can 
pick up that field and generate a \secondary\ current, and according to the design, it may have a higher or lower voltage, whatever is needed.,
       In an electromagnetic WAVE, such links of alternating magnetic and electric fields, propagate through space. You really need math to describe this, but see also the section on electromagnetic waves 
and   section #S-5 in \Stargazers.\,
       your web site is really awesome, but it doesn't answer the one question that sent me looking for info on the web in the first place.  Everything I have ever heard is that the only magnetic field 
that can induce a current is a fluctuating one.  Per my understanding a static magnetic field does NOT cause electrons to flow, only a varying one.  ,
      The magnetic field of the earth doesn't fluctuate around, so how is that the charged particles started circling around the lines of force.   And why would they spiral in towards the N/S magnetic 
poles?  I thought that the current is supposed to run strictly at right angles to the magnetic field??   ,
        As the poet wrote, \a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.\ There is so much involved in magnetism, in current and trapped particles, that a short message here won't do it justice! My advice 
is look up my web sites on the magnetosphere and the Earth's field, and take your time.  ,
     (1) True--a fluctuating magnetic field will induce a voltage, which can drive current, while a static magnetic field just sits there. But there exists another situation important in space (and in 
the dynamo mechanism of sunspots and the Earth's core): a magnetic field in a fluid conducting medium which FLOWS--where part of it moves with respect to the other. See,
 and sections that follow there.  One such flow is the flow of the solar wind past the Earth, and apparently, this creates currents which flow into the polar ionosphere and out of it, giving us aurora 
as by-product. The cartoon depicting this in the first of the above files is almost certainly an oversimplification (we really don't completely know the circuit), but that apparently is the source, and 
the energy comes from the kinetic energy of the solar wind.,
 (2)  Now those auroral currents: they indeed flow ALONG magnetic field lines. You write \I thought that the current is supposed to run strictly at right angles to the magnetic field,\ but that is true 
only for the magnetic field generated by the same current itself.  The field lines involved here are created by the earth's core, a much stronger source (50,000 nt, whereas the currents near Earth may 
generate 50 nT). The field of the currents themselves therefore only adds a little twist to those field lines.   About the spiraling, etc. you will have to read elsewhere \The Exploration of the Earth's 
Magnetosphere.\ I hope you will find it interesting.,
 which is very informative and approachable for lay people like myself.Based on this information, I would like to ask you: do all these waves, which 'inhabit' the space around us, impact upon us humans? 
if so, how? has there been any research on that topic, and if so,can you direct me to some sites where I could read about this most interesting topic.,
     I believe that migrating birds are one species which usesElectromagnetism to find their way around. Thus, it is not preposterous to thinkelectromagnetism affects us, or that we use it without realising 
it.,
     I would be very grateful if you would answer my query. I have read thatYou are interested in science education, and I've been trying to learn aboutscience over the last few years. Keep up with the 
good work!,
     You are right, space all around us is filled with electromagnetic waves from the entire radio spectrum--AM, FM, CB, TV, police, airplanes, satellites, radio-linked phones and computers, and more. 
They all overlap, and it seems almost amazing that out of all this jumble your radio, TV etc. can pick just the signal you need, and reject all the rest.,
     As far as living tissue is concerned, however, all that matters is the energy carried by the waves. The electromagnetic field varies too rapidly to have direct electric or magnetic effects, and on 
the other hand, the photons associated with it are too weak to affect thechemistry.,
     Still, the waves do deposit energy. In a microwave oven, that energy density is sufficient to cook food and boil water. Many years ago a similar principle (at lower frequency) was used in diathermy 
to gently heat sore parts of the human body (I don't think it's done any more). The energy density of radio waves in the space around us, though, is tiny by comparison, too small I think to have any effect.,

     About 30 years ago, an interesting article appeared in \Radio Science\ (I only recall part of the title, \A cabbage by any other name\). During the cold war, the Communist government of Poland maintained 
a powerful radio station, off limits and surrounded by a fence to keep people away from the intense radio waves. One spring day an engineer living nearby noticed a bird building a nest right on the feed 
horn from which the radio waves emerged, and out of curiosity, he followed it with binoculars, week after week. Eggs were laid, birds hatched, they grew and finally flew away, with no apparent bad effects. 
Thus it seems the effects of E-M radiation may be overrated.,
     As for your interest in science, the file you cite is old and is just an early summary file in a collection on the magnetosphere. I encourage you to dig more deeply! For a start, look up  http://www.phy6.org/prospect.htm.,

     My 10th grade daughter, Erica, will be competing in a Texas Symposium this year with a project in space weather. She wants to find the \best\ orbit for a space station (around earth) tomaintain by 
balancing a few factors including \space weather\. Yourwebsites have been very helpful in getting good background info andunderstanding.,
     However, she would like to use \real\ data to help form and prove herthesis. She has found some data taken from geostationary orbits, but wouldlike some for LEO and orbits at the Lagrange points. 
She knows of somesatellites, like SOHO at L1, Map and I believe Wind is there now. Most ofthe data she has is from Wind and some from ACE. However, we can't seem tofind any data for L2, L4, L5 (earth-moon). 
Do you know if any is availableand where?,
     Also, she'd like to know how much power would be needed to keep a stationin these orbits, assuming some \standard\ orbital perturbation. We've notbeen able to find that kind of data either, except 
a correction of 25 m/smentioned for L1 (which we can convert to power with a few assumptions).With all the hardware in LEO and geosynchronous, one would thinkcorrections for those would be easy to find, 
but we haven't succeeded yet.,
    Your project sounds imaginative, but when you start looking at details all sorts of questions pop up.  I assume of course you are planning a space station with human crew, not an automatic satellite.,

       Sending humans to space is dangerous and expensive, and for these reasons alone, the only suitable place is LEO. Out in synchronous orbit one is exposed to magnetic substorms and storms, which inject 
energetic particles into the environment, and both there and at more distant locations you are exposed to energetic protons from solar flares, which are even more penetrating. I have the trace of some 
of those, from storms around Halloween 2003,  in,
     In addition, raising a manned spaceship to such distances is difficult and expensive, as is resupplying it, and if a problem arises the crew cannot be quickly brought back.,
     What exactly would the purpose of such a space station be?  Certainly, not to observe \Space Weather. \ Such observations require particle sensors, magnetometers, radio receivers and special telescopes, 
and these operate well without human presence--better, in fact, because once they are sent up, they can operate for years without maintenance. And the places where you best observe (say) energetic particles 
are generally too risky to place humans.,
       About power to keep a station at Lagrangian points--you probably mean fuel, because power from solar cells is free. It depends for how long. \Wind\ has been cruising near L1 and L2 for years, and 
I think it still has some fuel.  Anyway, these are not places where you want to send human beings--supply is difficult, and a lot of shielding is required.,
     We have a pair of questions that we think that you could answer:          -- Is the space debris electrically charged?            - Is it because of the Earth magnetic field or the solar wind?,
      Most satellites in sunlight have a positive potential of a few volts, because the photons of sunlight knock electrons off their skin and give them an energy of a few electron volts. This process 
continues until the satellite is charged to an equivalent number of volts, and then no more electrons can leave.,
       If the satellite is in the Earth's shadow, this obviously stops, but then, if the satellite (or debris) is in the outer radiation belt (for instance, in synchronous orbit), it can get charged to 
hundreds of volts (sometimes even over a thousand) by electrons trapped in the magnetic field of the Earth.  Here is why.,
       In general, the radiation belt contains an equal density N of positive ions and negative free electrons. Any departure from such eutrality\ creates strong electric forces which quickly counteract 
it.  Trapped ions usually have a larger average energy than the electrons, but because electrons are nearly 2000 times lighter, they usually move with higher velocity--say V for electrons, v for ions. 
A square centimeter of the surface of a satellite or a piece of debris is hit each second by kNV electrons and kNv ions--k being a factor to take into account their distribution of angles. For both kinds 
of particles, N is the same and k nearly the same, so many more electrons hit, and the final voltage is something like the average electron energy in electron volts. This turns back part of the electrons 
and attracts ions, and equilibrium is reached when the surface receives the same rate of charging from either sign.,
       In sunlight, especially in low Earth orbit, the repelled electrons hang around at a short distance, so that any effects of charging are confined to the immediate vicinity of the satellite. The distance 
depends on the density of the surrounding plasma--it's of the order of the \Debye length.\  When charged by radiation in the Earth shadow, a similar effect occurs, even though in synchronous orbit the 
Debye length can be (I think) many meters.I hope all this information is helpful ,
      Look at it this way: a satellite can orbit the Earth for years, moving all the time in the Earth's magnetic field. When calculating the orbit of such a satellite, one has to take into account, in 
addition to the Earth's attraction, those of the Sun, Moon and the Earth's equatorial bulge, and if the orbit is low, also of the resistance of the fringes of the atmosphere. But one never includes the 
magnetic field in such a calculation, because it makes no difference.,
 In low Earth orbit it is gradually brought down by air resistance, but higher orbits, especially near-circular ones, are very durable. Maybe some day a robot can be sent to collect all the dead communication 
satellites in synchronous orbit into one big pile, which then could be sent off to deep space, but GPS satellites will probably stay up as long as the Earth lasts.David,
     I wonder if a rotating giant ring of wire in orbit (or a more rigid object such as a metal ring) surrounding all around the earth would produce electricity from the changing magnetic field of earth..,

  1.    In the section on The Solar Wind, you mention that \The plasma of the corona is so hot that the Sun's gravity cannot hold it down. Instead, the upper fringes flow away in all directions, in a constant 
stream of particles known as the solar wind.\,
     Wouldn't the intense gravitation field of the Sun cause the heavier positively charged particles to fall back to the Sun, resulting in the Solar Wind containing more electrons than protons? Or would 
any proton falling back, attract an electron along with it?,
        Your first question is quite perceptive. A similar question about the Earth's atmosphere was addressed by Pannekoek in 1922 and by Rosseland in 1924 (\Electrical state of a star\, Monthly Notices 
of Roy. Astron. Soc.84, 720-728, 1924). Here is the idea.,
       In an atmosphere consisting of a gas of molecular weight M, the density falls off exponentially, at a rate which depends on M, on the temperature of the gas and on the force of gravity. In the Earth's 
lower atmosphere, the density falls to one half every 5 kilometers or so (or else, by a factor e = 2.71828.. about every 8 kilometers, a distance known as scale height H). High temperatures and low M increase 
H and spread out the atmosphere, while strong gravity decreases H and makes the atmosphere more compact. Of course, the Earth's atmosphere is really a mixture of gases, but in the first 100 kilometers, 
enough collisions occur to create a single scale height, some sort of average among the components. ,
       Above 100 km collisions quickly become rare, so different gases with different M tend to separate, as has been observed. Pannekoek and Rosseland wondered--what about free electrons in the outer 
layers of a star (or for Earth, in the ionosphere)?  Their mass is so small, that their scale height should be much larger. Their layer should extend to great height, while the heavy oxygen ions (the main 
positive component) should stay well below them. ,
       They concluded this was not possible, because even a very slight separation of positive and negative charges would create an \ambipolar\ electric field, pulling electrons down and O+ ions up.  The 
field would effectively \add weight\ to the electrons and would \buoy up\ the O+ ions, until effectively each species senses the same downward force, contributed by both gravity and electric forces. With 
both species having the same \weight\, they also will have the same scale height, and the ionosphere would stay electrically neutral, as is observed.,
        The corona of the Sun behaves the same way, although the ambipolar field is probably much stronger, because of the high temperature.------    I am less certain about the second question--the solar 
wind is really not my field of expertise. In the Earth's lower atmosphere, temperature decreases with height, because heat from sunlight is mainly absorbed by the ground, at the bottom.  It is then transported 
by air flows and by radiation, absorption and re-radiation (by \greenhouse gases\) until it gets high enough to be radiated to space, not to return. That height defines the bottom of the stratosphere; 
other interesting effects occur higher up (e.g. absorption of UV by ozone), but we ignore them now. Because of the upwards flow of heat, the temperature is highest near the ground (where heat comes in) 
and decreases with height, up to the level where heat is given up.,
       Solar physicists expected the same to hold for the Sun, also heated from below, and it is still a mystery, why so much heat is deposited in the corona, making it much hotter than the photosphere 
below it. Still, once you get to the corona, you would expect the temperature to gradually decrease with height, as one gets away from the source of heat and as the rising gas expands.,
       Apparently this cooling is defeated by high heat conduction, because the gas is really an ionized plasma. Thus high layers are reheated from below, and an equilibrium solution, like that in the 
Earth's atmosphere, is not possible. The only solution Parker found in 1958 is a continued acceleration, until much of the heat is converted to kinetic energy. Mathematically the process has been compared 
to the acceleration of a rocket jet in the De-Laval nozzle (see section on Robert Goddard in \From Stargazers to Starships\).,
       I always thought the main acceleration took place in the first few solar radii--see Parker's papers.  The abstract you cite claims that no, it's above 10 solar radii.  I am no good judge of that, 
but also note that the abstract seems to refer to the solar wind above the Sun's poles, where field lines stick straight out and solar wind velocity is about double what it is near the ecliptic. Maybe 
the physics there is different.     ,
      I have experienced seeing the polar aurora in Maryland at least 3 times in 4 years. Is this unusual? If so, do you think we are experiencing more geomagnetic storms then in the past and if so, why 
do you think this is so?,
 I suspect these were the 3 events you observed, and the fact they all clustered around the same period of the year, between Halloween and November 10, seems to have been a coincidence.  We are now around 
solar minimum, and observers have already noted days when no sunspots were seen at all:,
        Looking for an answer to my question, I landed on your web site to find out that more or less the same (!) question had popped up several times already. This concerns possibility of a correlation 
between ozone depletion and the Earth's magnetic field in combination with solar effects. ,
        Has the possible connection between the steady decrease of the earths magnetic field and the decrease of magnetic particles (such as ozone) at times of solar bursts been investigated? ,
      The chemical explanation is solid, but doesn't explain how gaps in the ozone layer recover at random/differing speeds.  It doesn't seem to correspond to temperature. If it was just a chemical reaction, 
ozone would be transferred to the poles at a rate that corresponds with the intensity of the chemical reaction.  ,
     Ozone is formed by ultraviolet sunlight at altitudes between 25 and 40 kilometers. To escape from Earth along a magnetic field line, an ozone molecule would have to meet several conditions: ,
  ---It would have to be ionized--otherwise it is not affected by the magnetic field. --- It has to have enough energy to escape gravity, and  ---it must start off high enough so that collisions do not 
take that energy away.,
       While the atmosphere is quite rarefied at 25-40 kilometers, it still is dense enough for frequent collisions between molecules; the last collisions occur around 100 km or slightly higher. I do not 
know if ozone molecules can survive an ionization event without breaking up, and I do not think they have enough energy to escape.,
        Oxygen ions DO escape from the polar region along the magnetic field lines of the tail (which are connected to the poles all year round), as something called the \Polar Wind.\ These however are 
mainly O+ ions starting from the ionosphere, where temperatures (and energies) are higher and collisions are not frequent. ,
       The ozone layer is governed by a balance between processes which create ozone (from ordinary 2-atomic oxygen molecules) and the ones that remove it. In the winter polar cap, sunlight (which produces 
ozone) is absent, so the ozone layer is mostly governed by processes which remove ozone. For instance, if there exists enough wind to mix this layer with lower latitudes where ozone is produced even in 
winter, the layer will persist.,
       In recent years, a \hole\ was observed to form during the polar night, and that was taken as evidence that an additional removal mechanism, proposed (by Rowlands and Molina, I think) has become 
effective. That is catalytic breakup of ozone in the presence of chlorine, produced by the breakup of \Freon\ refrigerants in the upper atmosphere, under the action of ultraviolet sunlight.,
       I know of no \Brazilian gap\ in the ozone layer. There does exist a \south Atlantic Anomaly\ in the radiation belt, where it descends to lower levels, but that is not related.,
     Earlier observations with the unaided eye have been reported--e.g. in China and Russia--because when the rising or setting Sun is viewed through a thick haze, big sunspots can be distinguished (a 
few years ago I even watched that way a big double sunspot). But astronomers did not pay much attention.,
           The most thorough early study was made by Scheiner, who apparently introduced the safe observation method of projecting the Sun's image onto a white surface, and who published his findings in 
1630 in the book \Rosa Ursina Sive Sol.\,
     I came across your web site this morning and wondered if you could answer a very basic question. My daughter (age 13) is doing a science experiment involving a homemade magnetometer. She has suspended 
a magnet inside a soda bottle, attached a mirror to it, and there is a laser beam that is focused on the mirror at approximately a 45 degree angle. This projects a point on a chart on the wall approximately 
3 feet away. ,
     She/we have been randomly making recordings of the magnetometer since late November/early December. Readings are taken either 10, 15, or sometimes 30 minutes apart for a period of two-three hours 
at varying times of the day. Because we were aware of the activity on the sun 1/15/05, we decided to do readings 10 minutes apart yesterday for as long as we could. We began at 8:00 a.m. and, with the 
exception of missing here or there, continued until 12:30 a.m. It is reported that there also may be sometime of geomagnetic storm even today (spaceweather.com). ,
     Question: What would we see on the magnetometer that would demonstrate to us that some type of unusual magnetic activity appeared? The readings yesterday started off (on a centimeter scale of 1-27, 
with 15 being the center of the scale) usually are between 8-10, but have been known to be as high as 24-27. Yesterday, they hovered between 9-11, when they suddenly went up to 14-16 and stayed there for 
some time before eventually falling back to 12-13. Another phenomenon is that the laser beam will often be right on the line, then jump about 1-2 cm above the line or below the line.  Is any of this significant? 
,
     Thank you for your consideration. We can't find any place that answers these questions and I hope you can help. We have kept all other factors constant. We have noted if there has been any home disturbance 
that might affect the magnetometer and its readings (heat going in house, dryer running, etc,
        What you are trying to observe is a very small effect, probably far beyond the capability of a home-made magnetometer in a soda bottle. The magnetic field at your location has an intensity of about 
50,000 nano-Tesla (nT) whereas a magnetic storm may add to it about 50 nT.  Even if the addition were at right angles to the prevailing magnetic force (actually, it is almost anti-parallel) it would only 
shift the light spot (at a distance of 1 meter) by 1 millimeter. ,
       Some big magnetic storms occurred at the beginning of last November 2004 [letter was dated January 2005]--see                 http://www.phy6.org/Education/wmagstrm.htmlWe are currently still in 
their after-effects, a weakened field due (apparently) to a large reinforcement of the population of ions trapped around Earth from that time. See:                  http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/SatelliteRisks/lastweek.htmlwhich 
will tell you, at any time, about ongoing storms, and also                  http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/SatelliteRisks/dst_nowcast_month.png,
 At one time professional magnetometers were built like that, but with many refinements, e.g. the magnet was suspended from a long quartz fiber. I believe that today's instruments are all electronic, e.g. 
see               http://www.phy6.org/earthmag/magmeter.htm  ,
     Oh, one other thing--the magnet is suspended by a cotton thread througha straw which is glued to the top of the magnet. We've kept the humidityand temperature constant in the room, but the idea of 
moisture beingabsorbed by the thread is an interesting one. I have still yet to figureout what causes the beam to vary 1-2 cm in vertical orientation andmaybe that is an explanation. Thanks for the suggestion.,

      I'm doing a project at school, which involves the weather, and I would like to know some basic info to help me with my work.  Many of my friends are going to focus around storms, twisters etc. but 
I would like to find out which factors affect the weather.,
        Weather systems are driven by the Sun's heat, carried to Earth by sunlight. It is true, sunlight DOES consist of electromagnetic waves, but I don't think you were referring to light waves.  Sunlight 
deposits heat, and both weather and climate are the result of processes by which Earth returns that heat to space. (Of course, all this heat MUST be returned, otherwise Earth would get hotter and hotter!),

       The amount of energy in that heat is huge, while the energy provided to the surface of Earth by (for example) processes in the magnetic field of Earth is small.   Furthermore, magnetic variations 
usually affect materials which conducts electricity well, while the atmosphere in which we live is an excellent insulator.,
       I wrote about weather and climate in                 http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Sun1lite.htmand in the two sections which follow it.  (Section S-5 in that group explains what makes light \electromagnetic\). 
You might like to look there. If perhaps you want to write about lightning, see                http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Svandgrf.htm,
     I realize that it extends up much higher than the auroral oval but am wondering if there are any circumstances that you can identify and possibly describe whereby the polar pillar cusp might have 
been visible to the ancients globally? ,
       The cusp rumpet\ is usually filled with solar wind plasma, too rarefied to be seen, about 6 protons per cubic cm. Furthermore, they could not be seen unless they hit any gas, and of course, above 
an altitude of (say) 500 km, the atmosphere is much too rarefied to form much of an obstacle (and if it did, the solar wind would probably be stopped by it).,
        The solar wind in the cusp does hit the upper atmosphere and produces there a sort of dull red aurora, better seen by instruments than by the eye. See for instance  ,
     I doubt ancient civilizations would have noticed it, even without the visual handicap, because they could see the cusp only in mid-winter (in the summer the part of the sky where the cusp comes down 
is lit too brightly by sunlight). At that time the angle between the Earth magnetic axis and the Sun's direction is large, which makes the cusp migrate to higher latitudes  where even fewer people can 
observe it. As far as I know, cusp observations from the ground have been done mainly from Svalbard (Spitzbergen). ,
       So what? If I were an astronaut candidate, I would sign such a waiver in a heartbeat.  If I am about to be launched atop a giant rocket into the vacuum of space, perhaps to the Moon, certainly facing 
a fiery reentry before returning home--then the risk from a moderate dose of radiation ranks far below other dangers! ,
     Electrons of MeV energies in the outer belt are more penetrating, but there are not enough of them. Remember--communications and weather satellites operate in synchronous orbit, in the heart of the 
outer belt, year after year! ,
       Now if you were to fly to Mars--a trip of 8.5 months each way, plus a forced wait on Mars, whose atmosphere is too thin to protect--solar eruptions could be a problem requiring attention (though 
not insoluble). But we are not at that stage yet.,
      I am a sophomore in college.  I amdoing a physics lab about understanding the motion of a charged particlein the presence of an electric and magnetic field to estimate the massof the electron.  My 
question is would it be possible to  use theearth's magnetic field to deflect the beam and how large a tube wouldyou need?,
       In the lab, though, with short distances, you want to use a stronger magnetic field.  Besides, if you use an artificial magnetic field to deflect electrons, you can switch it off and find its effect 
by comparing deflections with and without.  You can't well switch off the Earth's field for calibration.,
       You realize, of course, that the deflection depends on the ratio e/m, between the charge and the mass of the electron.  You won't have the mass of the electron unless you can measure \e\ independently. 
 That is what Millikan's oil-drop experiment is for--right?,
 The Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) and Aurora Australis (Southern Lights) are the result of electrons colliding with the upper reaches of Earth’s atmosphere. (Protons cause faint and diffuse aurora, 
usually not easily visible to the human eye.) The electrons are energized through acceleration processes in the downwind tail (night side) of the magnetosphere and at lower altitudes along auroral field 
lines. The accelerated electrons follow the magnetic field of Earth down to the Polar Regions where they collide with oxygen and nitrogen atoms and molecules in Earth’s upper atmosphere. In these collisions, 
the electrons transfer their energy to the atmosphere thus exciting the atoms and molecules to higher energy states. When they relax back down to lower energy states, they release their energy in the form 
of light. This is similar to how a neon light works. The aurora typically forms 80 to 500 km above Earth’s surface.,
 Earth’s magnetic field guides the electrons such that the aurora forms two ovals approximately centered at the magnetic poles. During major geomagnetic storms these ovals expand away from the poles such 
that aurora can be seen over most of the United States. Aurora comes in several different shapes. Often the auroral forms are made of many tall rays that look much like a curtain made of folds of cloth. 
During the evening, these rays can form arcs that stretch from horizon to horizon. Late in the evening, near midnight, the arcs often begin to twist and sway, just as if a wind were blowing on the curtains 
of light. At some point, the arcs may expand to fill the whole sky, moving rapidly and becoming very bright. This is the peak of what is called an auroral substorm.,
 Then in the early morning the auroral forms can take on a more cloud-like appearance. These diffuse patches often blink on and off repeatedly for hours, then they disappear as the sun rises in the east. 
The best place to observe the aurora is under an oval shaped region between the north and south latitudes of about 60 and 75 degrees. At these polar latitudes, the aurora can be observed more than half 
of the nights of a given year.,
 When space weather activity increases and more frequent and larger storms and substorms occur, the aurora extends equatorward. During large events, the aurora can be observed as far south as the US, Europe, 
and Asia. During very large events, the aurora can be observed even farther from the poles. (Tips on viewing the aurora and maps of the typical extent of the aurora). Of course, to observe the aurora, 
the skies must be clear and free of clouds. It must also be dark so during the summer months at auroral latitudes, the midnight sun prevents auroral observations. Photo by Neal Brown (Fairbanks),
 Drag is a force exerted on an object moving through a fluid, and it is oriented in the direction of relative fluid flow. Drag acts opposite to the direction of motion and tends to slow an object. As an 
example, think of running against a high wind and feeling the drag pushing you back in the direction of relative fluid flow. This same force acts on spacecraft and objects flying in the space environment. 
Drag has a significant impact on spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO), generally defined as an orbit below an altitude of approximately 2,000 kilometers (1,200 mi). Although the air density is much lower 
than near the Earth’s surface, the air resistance in those layers of the atmosphere where satellites in LEO travel is still strong enough to produce drag and pull them closer to the Earth (Figure 1, shown 
above, the region of the Earth’s atmosphere where atmospheric drag is an important factor perturbing spacecraft orbits.(NASA/GSFC)). The International Space Station (ISS) and the Hubble Space Telescope 
are examples of spacecraft operating in LEO.,
 The drag force on satellites increases during times when the Sun is active. When the Sun adds extra energy the atmosphere the low density layers of air at LEO altitudes rise and are replaced by higher 
density layers that were previously at lower altitudes. As a result, the spacecraft now flies through the higher density layer and experiences a stronger drag force. When the Sun is quiet, satellites in 
LEO have to boost their orbits about four times per year to make up for atmospheric drag. When solar activity is at its greatest over the 11-year solar cycle, satellites may have to be maneuvered every 
2-3 weeks to maintain their orbit [1].,
 In addition to these long-term changes in upper atmospheric temperature and density caused by the solar cycle, interactions between the solar wind and the Earth’s magnetic field during geomagnetic storms 
can produce large short-term increases in upper atmosphere temperature and density, increasing drag on satellites and changing their orbits. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) has to 
re-identify hundreds of objects and record their new orbits after a large solar storm event (Figure 2). During the March 1989 storm event, for example, the NASA's Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) spacecraft 
was reported to have \dropped as if it hit a brick wall\ due to the increased atmospheric drag.,
 It is extremely important to keep track of spacecraft and objects flying in the space to avoid collisions with space junk and orbital debris that may be in their path. Collision avoidance has become of 
increasing concern due to the recent accidental hypervelocity collision of two intact spacecraft in February, 2009. The collision occurred at an altitude of 790 km, leaving pieces of debris that have been 
gradually separated into different orbital planes around the Earth, threatening other satellites for the next few decades. Since 1957, more than 25,000 artificial space debris have been cataloged (Figure 
3), many of which have naturally decayed into the lower atmosphere. Currently, the U.S. Space Surveillance Network (SSN) tracks over 20,000 man-made objects larger than 10 cm in size, which are known as 
the “catalogued” population. Debris between 1 cm and 10 cm (approximately 500,000), referred to as the “lethal” population, are the most concerning as they cannot be tracked or cataloged and can cause 
catastrophic damage when colliding with a satellite. Objects smaller than 1 cm (approximately 135 million measuring from 1mm to 1cm, and many more smaller than 1 mm) that could disable a satellite upon 
impact are termed the “risk” population [3].,
 Figure 3. Thousands of manmade objects—95 % of them “space junk”— occupy low Earth orbit. Each black dot in this image shows either a functioning satellite, an inactive satellite, or a piece of debris. 
Although the space near Earth looks crowded, each dot is much larger than the satellite or debris it represents, and collisions are extremely rare. (NASA illustration courtesy Orbital Debris Program Office.),

 The consequences of a spacecraft collision with debris can range from performance degradation to failure and satellite fragmentation. In LEO, debris as small as a few millimeters in diameter can puncture 
unprotected fuel lines and damage sensitive components, while debris smaller than 1 mm in diameter can erode thermal surfaces and damage optics. Although smaller objects can partly be mitigated through 
the use of meteor bumpers, such as on the ISS, the only way to mitigate larger objects impact is to maneuver the spacecraft to avoid collision. Such maneuvers are expensive, impact the operation of sensitive 
experiments on board, and ideally should only be done if the chance of collision is high. To assess the risk, and mitigate the likelihood of collision, the SSN monitors these objects and predicts their 
orbits about three days ahead.,
 Orbit propagation models are used to determine the location of space objects in the relatively near-term (typically over a period of a few days or less) for purposes of collision avoidance or re-entry 
predictions, and also to make long-term predictions (typically over a period of years) about the debris environment. Both short- and long-term propagation models must take into account the various forces 
acting on space objects in Earth’s orbit including atmospheric drag. Since accurate orbit propagation models that include all forces acting on an orbiting object can be very computation intensive, most 
models take into account only the forces that most strongly affect the space objects in particular orbital regions. The primary forces acting on a space object in LEO are atmospheric drag and gravitational 
attraction of the Earth [4].,
 The largest uncertainty in determining orbits for satellites operating in low Earth orbit is the atmospheric drag. Drag is the most difficult force to model mainly because of the complexity of neutral 
atmosphere variations driven by the Sun, and the propagation from below of lower atmosphere waves [5, 6]. Atmospheric neutral density models routinely used in orbit determination applications are mainly 
empirical. These models are based on historical observations to which parametric equations have been fitted, representing the known variations of the upper atmosphere with local time, latitude, season, 
solar and geomagnetic activity [7, 8, 9]. First-principle (or physics-based) models can also provide information about the atmospheric density conditions. Unlike empirical models, first principles physics 
models seek to calculate a physical quantity starting directly from established laws of physics without making assumptions such as empirical or fitted parameters. Taking into account the interactions between 
upper atmosphere winds, composition and densities, first-principle models are able to provide a realistic representation of neutral density in the upper atmosphere if the magnitude, spatial distribution, 
and temporal evolution of the solar sources can be defined with sufficient accuracy, especially in long-duration magnetic storm events [10].,
 Going to the CTIPe web page shows a simulation using the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere-plasmasphere electrodynamics (CTIPe; https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/ctipe-total-electron-content-forecast) 
physics-based model [11], illustrates the increase in atmospheric density at 400km altitude during the occurrence of a large magnetic storm on May 15, 2005, as a satellite (represented by the black diamond) 
flies through. The atmospheric density is given in Kg/m3. As the time progresses, the satellite will encounter denser air following the beginning of the magnetic storm (starting around 06:00 Universal 
Time). As the storm comes to end, atmospheric density slowly goes back to quiet conditions.,

    The strength of an induced electric field depends on the rate the magnetic field changes: the gradual change of the Earth's \main\ field is so slow--5 to 7% per century--that any electric field generated 
by it is too weak to matter, or even to be observed.      Much more rapid variations (though of limited extent) occur in magnetic storms and substorms, and they induce secondary currents at Earth--in the 
ground (\earth currents\), in power grids close to the auroral zone and even in Alaska's oil pipeline. On the rare occasions when they were unusually intense, they have disrupted electric power (caused 
a \black-out\) or damaged network equipment, but they generally only last a short time.       The Earth's atmosphere also has an appreciable electric field , but its source is thunderstorm activity (http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Svandgrf.htm). 
Because air is such an excellent electrical insulator, the currents driven by that electric field are small and unimportant.  And because thunderstorm activity shifts all the time, the pattern of the Earths 
electric field constantly changes, too.,
 I understand that we can screen out magnetic fields from a region bywrapping a piece of soft iron around the region. However, I alsounderstand that soft iron can easily receive induced magnetism when 
placednear a permanent magnet.,
 So now my question is that:How is it possible to shield a region that near a permanent magnet byusing a piece of soft iron? Won't this piece of soft iron eventuallyget induced magnetization and have the 
ability to attract any magneticmaterial that is nearby.?,
   Soft iron--especially the kind used in shielding (mumetal, etc.) doesnot take permanent magnetization. Steel does, but even there, themagnetic intensity must be high enough for that to occur.,
   In shielding (e.g. a video tube) you wrap a sheet of soft iron aroundthe shielded object, and the magnetic field lines which would have closedthrough the interior are diverted and close through the 
shield instead.Therefore any magnetic field that existed in the interior is greatlyweakened.  The field inside the iron sheet is stronger, but that is noproblem--in fact, that is what we wanted to do, 
take the magnetic fieldfrom the inside volume and put it elsewhere (you can't just get rid of it,for all magnetic field lines have to close somewhere).,
 I am a student working on a science fair project which dealswith possible use of the solar wind in space travel.  My hypothesis is thations in solar wind can be gathered and used as propulsion for long-termspaceflights. 
 In theory, would this work? Thank you. SEG,
                                                 Something like this has been considered, but using the pressure ofsunlight rather than that of the solar wind (I have not calculated it,but it seems the 
former is much bigger). The idea is to spread a hugesail, say of mylar with a reflecting coating (the kind that is usedto darken glass walls in office building) and have it face the sun,so that sunlight 
bounces back.  It is analogous to the way the windpushes a sailing ship and in fact, this has been called a \solar sail.\None has been tried so far. I believe there was even a story byArthur Clark on that 
idea.,
   By the way, sunlight pressure and solar wind pressure combine topush comet tails away from the sun--sunlight pushes the part of the tailconsisting of dust, the solar wind pushes the part which consists 
of ions.The two tails are sometimes distinct, and people who watched the bright comet Hale-Bopp through binoculars could see both. Good luck with your project!,
 I am an 8th grade science teacher in Texas.  I am trying to findout if anyone has ever tried to make a working modelof a sphere capable of generating a magnetosphere.  Ifeel that the testing of such a 
model in space couldprovide some insight into geologically problems suchas why the earth's magnetic field periodically reverses itself.  Pleaselet me know if anyone has ever made such a model to test in 
space and whathas been learned from such models.  Thank you -- Jim,
   Briefly: Yes, people have devised working models of the magneto-sphere, but while such models have provided clues on magnetic fieldsin space, they tell nothing about reversals of the Earth's field.For 
that you have to probe the inside of the Earth, on which whateverhappens in space has little effect. However, there also existsprogress in that direction.,
  Back to your question: The Earth's magnetism affects surrounding space in interesting ways.  But surrounding space has very little effect on it--things would be just the same if the Earth were a hunk 
of magnetized iron. Look up under \Terrella\ (in the index here) and you might see why ideas like yours are nearly 400 years old!  ,
  Yes, it has been suggested that the astronauts on the shuttlestick out a large magnet and see how it reacts with the ionizedgas (or plasma) through which its orbital motion carries it. It's hard to control 
such an experiment, hard to put measuring instruments around it, so scientists perform it instead in a lab--put a magnetized ball (errella\) in a vacuum tank, blow a puff of plasma at it, and measure what 
happens. Prof. Hafez U-Rahman at the University of California, Riverside, has such a tank and has experimented with it.,
  But the source of field reversals is not above our heads--rather,it is beneath our feet. Why is the Earth a magnet, you may ask?  Itcould in principle have a huge iron magnet somewhere in its middle,but 
that does not work: any magnetic material loses its magnetism whenheated to red heat, and the interior of the Earth is much hotter thanthat, in fact, earthquake waves tell us that in the middle is a moltencore 
(and inside that, a solid inner core, but at a temperature of many thousands of degrees).,
   So the Earth's magnetism is not produced by magnetized iron, but rather,by electric currents (see \magnetism\ in \Exploration\). Those currentsare produced by a \dynamo process\ (see again, \Exploration\) 
in theflowing hot metal (we think) of the Earth's interior.  The Earth'smagnetic field changes slowly, so that magnetic charts have to beredrawn every few decades, and that is apparently because the patternof 
the currents shifts.,
   Recently, the process has been successfully simulated by a computer.And yes, the poles sometimes reverse. Oh, and did you know that thepolar field of the Sun reverses every sunspot cycle, every 11 years 
or so?David Stern,
 Dear sir, I wonder if you could tell me exactly what the VAN ALLEN BELT isand how much radiation does it contain, i.e. how many rems of radiation arethere out there?,
         The radiation belts are regions of high-energy particles, mainlyprotons and electrons, held captive by the magnetic influence of theEarth. They have two main sources.  A small but very intense 
\inner belt\(some call it \The Van Allen Belt\ because it was discovered in 1958 byJames Van Allen of the University of Iowa) is trapped within 4000 miles oror so of the Earth's surface.  It consists mainly 
a high-energy protons(10-50 MeV) and is a by-product of the cosmic radiation, a thin drizzleof very fast protons and other nuclei which apparently fill all our galaxy.,
  In addition there exist electrons and protons (and also oxygen particlesfrom the upper atmosphere) given moderate energies (say 1-100 keV; 1 MeV= 1000 keV) by processes inside the domain of the Earth's 
magnetic field.Some of these electrons produce the polar aurora (orthern lights\) whenthey hit the upper atmosphere, but many get trapped, and among thoseprotons and positive particles have most of the 
energy .,
    I looked up a typical satellite passing the radiation belts (ellipticorbit, altitude ranging from 200 miles to 20000 miles) and the radiation dosage per year is about 2500 rem, assuming one is shielded 
by 1 gr/cm-square of aluminum (about 1/8\ thick plate) almost all of it while passing the inner belt.  But for ourselves no danger exists. The way these particles move in the magnetic field prevents most 
of them from hitting the atmosphere, and the few scattered into orbits that intersect the ground, are absorbed by the atmosphere before they get very far. Even the space station would be safe, because 
the trapped orbits usually stop above it--any particles dipping deeper down are lost much faster than they can be replenished.,
 I'm curious as to what effect the shape of a magnet has on the nature ofthe magnetic field patterns generated.  For example, would there be anysignificant or even noticeable difference between a cylindrical 
barmagnet with fillet 'radiused' edges and one without the fillets?,
 Instead of your run-of-the mill bar magnet or cylindrical bar magnetwith flat ends, what can be expected in a spherical magnet, an oval/oblatespheroid ('jelly bean' shape), a cylindrical bar magnet w/hemisphericaldivots 
scooped out of the ends?,
             The shaping of magnetic fields is a complicated art, withformulas and computer codes.  In general engineers separate the sourceof the magnetic field--an electromagnet or a piece of magnetized 
iron--from the \pole pieces\ which shape the field, which are usually made ofsoft iron or special alloys and are fitted to the ends of the magnet.,
   The virtue of soft iron is to confine the magnetic field lines inside it.So if a magnet has conical pole pieces, tapering to a sharp point, theiron will try to keep the field lines inside itself even 
though (as oneapproaches the tip) the cross section becomes smaller and smaller. Whenthe lines finally emerge near the tip (the must emerge somewhere), they form a tight small bundle, and therefore the 
magnetic field is much stronger there--though in a much smaller area--than it would be in the absence of any pole pieces. Recording heads of audio and video tape recorders use such tapered poles to concentrate 
the magnetic field to the strength needed for writing a record. ,
   I don't know about spherical and elliptical magnets, but formulasprobably exist for them. Some intricately shaped magnetic fields areused inside research accelerators which speed up protons and electronsto 
very high energies, to keep the beam confined to its vacuum tube,to focus the beam's particles and to push them out of the machine ontothe target area. As noted above, it is a whole science unto itself.,

 My name is Jon and I am a 6th grader. I have aninvention using magnetism to prevent cars from being stolen and to keep them from bumping into each other. I tried making an electromagnet with a 9Volt battery, 
but it wasn't very strong. Can you tell me how to make a strongermagnet? Can I use a larger battery or real electricity? Thank you,,
   I don't know what your invention is, what the magnet is supposed to do.If you want it to close an electric circuit, you are essentially buildinga device known as a relay.  You can probably get old relays 
from a radiorepair shop, or any place which has junked electric devices (cars haverelays, too). Or ask your science teacher for help.,
   Building electromagnets without calculating and measuring is not simple:you must match the size of the wire and its length to the source ofcurrent (manufacturers of relays do so, of course). In particular 
becautious about using house current (you call it \real electricity\,but anything you use is real electricity). A small battery is limitedin what it can do--usually, not much.  House current is backed 
by bigpower stations, which can pour a LOT of \juice\ into whatever you attach.If your wire is short and thick, it will try to draw a big electric current:a battery will be unable to provide it, but the 
power station can and will, enough electricity to perhaps melt a wire and cause a fire, or at least blow the fuses or trip the circuit breakers which are meant toprotect houses against just this.,
   Also, house current is backed by a relatively high \electric pressure\(voltage) and can cause a nasty shock. Finally, even if you got themagnet working on this, it would hum and jitter, because houses 
have an\alternating current\, which goes down to zero and up again more than100 times each second. If you ever heard an electric device humming(old fluorescent lights somethimes do), that is the reason.,

   So my advice--stick to batteries, get a relay (you can also disassembleit and use just its magnet, if that's what you want), and most important,read and learn.  You are just at the very beginning of 
an interestingadventure.,
   It wouldn't work, for several reasons, but mainly, the ring's magneticfield would only affect charged particles of the solar wind, and thesecarry much less energy than ordinary sunlight. A mirror is 
a much moreefficient way of harvesting solar energy.,
 I have a question pertaining to the forecast Solar Maximum.I have heard about the upcoming Solar Maximum starting soon (CNN.comarticle, Nov. 11, 1999). I have also heard (unofficially), that there could 
be a very large solar storm near the end of April.,
  Finally, it is relatively commonly known that there is going to be anunusual alignment of the planets in our solar system at the beginningof May, 2000. Has there been an in-depth study to determine effects 
of thecombination of these phenomena, and the potential impacts on both oursolar system, and our planet? Could this combination of phenomena:,
    I am aware that during our earth's geological history themagnetic poles have sometimes changed. Could this happen here with the combination of a large CME and gravitational forces?,
 I hope you don't mind this intrusion, I did receive these e-mailaddresses through a simplistic study I conducted on the internetsurrounding this conceptual theory.  No calculations, or in-depth studyhas 
occurred, but I have a hunch this should be looked at more closely,and by qualified people.,
  Your message made me once more appreciatethe amount of misleading and loose information circulating on the web.I have spend a great deal of time and thought on creating a web sitedescribing what is known 
about the magnetic field of the Earth andthe Sun's effects on it, and for a real understanding, you betterlook there: http://www.phy6.org/Education/Intro.html,
  To answer your questions in brief: The solar maximum is already here. It isnot an abrupt event you can date, but the crest of a wave whose width extends over at least several years. From what I have 
heard, the current peak is lowerthan expected.,
  No one can predict a large solar storm months ahead of time--the bestwe can say is that they are more frequent near the peak of the sunspotcycle. Some big ones cause little disturbance near Earth--depends 
onfactors like the precise orientation of the interplanetary magneticfield. Planetary alignments have no effect whatsoever. [Please look up the following item below, too!],
  The large planets you read about are unlike anything in the solar system--usually Jupiter-size or bigger, and very close to the star (this has todo with the method of detection--it's hard to detect distant 
planets).,
  No solar eruption has ever been found to affect the solid Earth. Theirenergy is too small, and almost all of it is dissipated outside thebreathable atmosphere. No earthquakes follow CMEs.,
   There exists a tempting closeness between the length of the solarcycle and the orbital period of Jupiter, but I don't think the twoare related. I cannot imagine any mechanism coupling the two--especially 
since the Sun rotates in about 27 days, so the relativeperiod of Jupiter going around the Sun is of that order. Furthermore,the solar wind moves with supersonic speed, which means that solardisturbances 
can (and do) travel downstream with it, but disturbancesfrom a planetary magnetosphere (whatever they might be) propagate too slowly to make it back to the Sun, upstream against the flow of the solar wind. 
 Above and beyond all these, there is always the question of energy--the currency in which the price of any physical process must be paid.The energy required by the solar cycle is much bigger than anythingplanetary 
magnetospheres can supply.,
   So what causes the cycle? The Sun rotates unevenly, slower near thepoles, faster near the equator, probably because of the way gas flowsin it (Jupiter also has such a difference). In a magnetized hot 
gas,this difference deforms and amplifies the magnetic field, and thereexist some general theories of the sunspot cycle based on this, althoughmany details remain unclear. The general idea is that as the 
magneticfield gets amplified, it forms concentrated \ropes\ which push outthe hot gas, and when they reach a certain strength, gas is displaced making the ropes are light enough to float to the surface, 
where they are seen as sunspots.,
   Again, the magnetosphere is a relatively weak influence on the Earth'sinternal magnetism--even a big magnetic storm only reduces the surfaceequatorial field by 1%. Furthermore, the time scale differs--reversalshappen 
on time scales of 0.5-1 million years, while magnetic stormshave a 1-day scale or faster.,
  Magnetic reversals seem to be connected to the currents which circulate in the Earth's core, presumably driven by flows there, which (like flows on the Sun) get their energy from heat. The magnetic field 
is fairly complicated--the2-pole structure we see (north-south poles) is dominant, but not by as much asit seems, because more complicated modes get filtered away faster bydistance. Right now the 2-pole 
field is declining at about 5-7% percentury, but the late Ed Benton has shown that the more complex partsare gaining energy, and the total sum is fairly constant. Maybe, when areversal occurs, for a while 
the 2-pole part gets small and the totalfield is rather complex (4, 8 poles..), and later when the simple patternre-emerges, it is reversed.,
    I don't know where you obtained your information, but I guess you are not referring to sunlight (one kind of radiation), but to ionizingradiation--fast ions and electrons, like those emitted by radioactivesubstances.,

  In general, I would not worry about such particles. Even at the heightof the 11-year sunspot cycle, they are emitted quite rarely, maybe fora few hours in the year. Furthermore, we have a double protectionagainst 
them--the thickness of the atmosphere which stops all but afew (at energies which most solar eruptions do not reach), and themagnetic field of the Earth, which deflects them from middle and lowlatitudes. 
The only aircrews who might have cause to worry would bethose of the Concorde, flying 15 km high or more, and only when theirpath passes over the polar caps. The Concorde, I believe, has radiationdetectors, 
so even in such an event, a red light would flash and thepilot will have time to descend to lower altitudes, where the atmosphereis a sufficient shield.,
 I am a auto mechanic and I have a simple question for you.Scientists say their are 2 holes in the atmosphere, ironically theyare around the north and south pole, and they blame these holeson chlorine 
monoxide or refrigerants i.e. Fluorocarbons (CFC) escaping intothe ozone. Wouldn't the more likely cause of the holes be the magneticlines of flux?     One more quick question:  could there be a wayof 
tapping into that magnetic field as an energy source?,
   There do indeed exist two \holes\ in the Earth's magnetic field,around the MAGNETIC poles, whose magnetic field lines go very farfrom Earth and afford an easy connection to the solar wind andto interplanetary 
plasma phenomena. On those lines we do observe\polar rain\, a drizzle of fairly energetic electrons (more energythan those of the ionosphere, less than those of the usual polar aurora)which seem to come 
from the Sun. Also, when solar activity floodsinterplanetary space with energetic ions and electrons, that is wherethey are most likely to come down to Earth.,
   However, the creation and destruction of the ozone layer does notinvolve the magnetic field. Instead, its factors are chemistry andsunlight, and the \ozone hole\ is around the geographic poles, notthe 
magnetic ones.,
   The ozone layer is maintained by an equilibrium between creation ofozone by ultra-violet sunlight, and its destruction by various naturalprocesses (this is not my field, and I do not know details, but 
a lot of chemistry is involved). During polar winter, the polar cap is dark and ozone is not created, just destroyed (near the pole, with just a few hours of sunlight and the sun shining at a shallow angle, 
ozone creation is also reduced). The observation of an \ozone hole\ in recent years suggest accelerated destruction, as predicted by Rowland and Molina.,
   As for tapping electric currents from space, I don't think it will work,because (1) they are very spread-out, by our standards--how can you tapa current sheet 100-1000 miles wide?; and (2) between us 
and them liesthe atmosphere, a very effective electric insulator--as is well knownto power companies, which string their high-voltage cables through airwithout worrying about the power leaking away. Even 
if we knew how to tap those current sheets, we would lack the extension cords needed for reaching them.,
           There exist many different ways of separating ions from electrons.Some of them are used commercially--just try a web search engine on \ion sources\. Of course, any ion accelerator of the many 
used to study elementary particles and high-energy interactions needs such a source for generating its beam, before that beam is accelerated.,
   Some types of radiation detectors, e.g. Geiger counters (described in\Exploration\) have radiation hit gas inside a tube. Current then brieflyflows across the tube--and if you think about it, it is 
not enough tocollect negative electrons by the central wire, which is maintained atabout +1000 volts. The electric circuit will not be closed unless anequal electric charge flows to the outer cyclinder, 
carried by positiveions.,
  \Ionization chambers\ operate similarly but at lower voltage--theyonly collect the originally produced ions and electrons, creating amuch smaller signal, but one which tells about the initiating particlefrom 
the ionization it produces.,
   The mass spectrometer is an instrument creating an ion beam andthen measuring the mass of its components by bending the beamin a magnetic field. Ancient artifacts of wood or fabric are datedby measuring 
the amount of carbon-14 in them, a heavy isotope ofcarbon created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere and decayingradioactively with a lifetime of about 5730 years. At one time theamount of carbon-14 was 
derived by measuring its faint radioactivity,an insensitive process which required large samples. Today a tinysample is converted into a mass spectrometer beam, and the atoms ofnormal carbon-12 and of 
radioactive carbon 14 are simply counted.,
    I presume you looked at the web site \The Exploration of the Earth'sMagnetosphere\ at http://www.phy6.org/Education/Intro.html.Linked to the end of that site is a web copy of the article \A BriefHistory 
of Magnetospheric Physics During the Space Age,\ Rev Geophys.34,p. 1-31, 1996, http://www.phy6.org/Education/bh2_1.html,
 The above address gives the beginning of the article, which was dividedinto 8 sections (including references). In unit 3, \Artificial Beltsand Early Studies\, below Figure 3, you will find a short discussionof 
\Starfish\ and some references. I particularly recommend the 1968 bookby Wilmot Hess, and perhaps the 1965 article in Rev. Geophys. Space Phys.by Hess at all. Bill Hess was personally involved in measuring 
the Starfishbelt (he was my boss at the time!) and has many details which might behard to find. The article by Brown et al. (1963) is also very useful,because it is just the introduction to an entire issue 
of the Journal ofGeophysical Research, devoted to Starfish.,
  You may not find there the reason for the \Starfish\ experiment.The US Air Force at the time was worried about nuclear war, in which itwould have to send bombers over Russia (as in the movie \Dr. Strangelove\).Someone 
had the idea that by exploding a hydrogen bomb at the other endof the field line, which was not defended, enough fast electrons couldbe produced to saturate the ionosphere at the other end to an extent 
whichwould interfere with defending radars. Legend has it that when Hans Bethe, heard about this, he pulled out a piece of paper and quickly calculated \it would work, but only for 15 minutes,\ which turned 
out about right. I was never able to confirm that story, however.,
   The first artificial belts were produced by the \Argus\ experimentdescribed in the same web document, at the beginning of this section.Argus also had a special issue of JGR devoted to it, referenced 
in thearticle.,
   The Soviet Union has detonated some very large hydrogen bombs in space,and the book by Hess has dates and some graphs. It was their luck thatthose explosions were near Novaya Zemlya, where magnetic 
field lines arelong and trapping does not last: they were gone in about 2 weeks. The USchose a near-equatorial site, on field lines where trapping is very stable,and the artificial belts lasted into the 
next solar maximum, damagingsatellites and raising concerns.  ,
 I teach 9th grade Earth Science and my class would appreciate the answerto the following question. What is the effect of the magnetic reversalsof the poles on the migratory paths of sea turtles and certain 
birds andfish?,
   I heard that some bacteria, suspended in water, find the \down\direction using magnetic materials embedded in their bodies. Whenthey are moved to the opposite hemisphere, they tend to orientthemselves 
in the opposite direction. That's as far as I know,
 I'm a teacher from Sweden. I'm also studying science and I have aquestion that I would like to ask you, about magnetism. I found youre-mail at http://www.phy6.org/Education/The Earth's geographic northpole 
is near the magnetic northpole. But ifthe Earth's magnetic northpole is up north, why does a compass point upnorth? Then the magnetic northpole has to be a magnetic southpole,because south and north attract 
each other. So, my question is: Whyisn't the Earth's magnetic northpole a rue\ magnetic northpole?,
   Your question has come up before and it is not really about science,but about language. The needle of the compass--or of any bar magnet--has two ends, the N end tends to point to the north magnetic 
pole ofEarth and the S end tends to point to the south magnetic pole.,
  So, if the source of the Earth's magnetism were a very powerful barmagnet somewhere deep inside, where would its N pole be and where itsS pole? The answer, of course, is--the S pole would be at the northernend 
and the N pole at the southern end. How confusing!,
   Teachers and students have struggled with this ambiguity since timesimmemorial. One popular solution has been to call the N pole of a barmagnet, not its orth pole\ but its orth-seeking pole\, and theother 
end its \south-seeking pole,\ marking them N and S for short.You might try doing so with your students, too.,
 I am a complete novice with regard to electric and magnetic energy.Where might I find some simple introduction to magnetic and electricenergy? Are human (or other living creatures) producers of electric 
andmagnetic energy?,
   Look up some physics textbook at a level you are comfortable with,section on electricity and magnetism. You will find it describescomponents named capacitors and inductors. A charged capacitor storeselectric 
energy, and an inductor with current flowing through it storesmagnetic energy. Break the current through the inductor, or short-circuit the capacitor andthat energy can create a visible spark.,
   The amount of energy stored, in general, is not large, but in devicesusing alternating current or radio frequency, you usually only needstore energy for half a cycle, a short time. Thus an inductor 
(theballast coil) is sufficient to keep a fluorescent tube lit when the ACcycle goes through zero (or more accurately, relight it afterwards), anda power supply converting AC to DC (on a radio, etc.) has 
a capacitorto maintain the power input over such breaks, too.,
   The human body stores no appreciable electric energy, because itconducts electricity too well (blood is a salt solution!) to holdelectric charge; an exception may exist with electric eels, I don't know 
how they work. Also,electrical currents in the body are tiny, so no appreciable magneticenergy is generated.,
 I am a student at the American school in Karachi and have beendoing research on solar wind. I have found your website to be auseful source for primary data but have one question:is there a relationship 
between solar wind and solar flares? I havegathered lots of data on both but they don't seem to be connected.,
 Flares are impulsive releases of magnetic energy, seen by the lightthey emit in the chromosphere--which is below the corona, though theplace where the energy is released may be elsewhere. Flares are quitesporadic--most 
of the time there are no conspicuous ones. So on the faceof it, no connection.,
 Does ozone also effect the magnetic field around the earth? I know it is also highly magnetic. What effect would the depletion of ozone, caused by pollution have on the magnetic field surrounding the 
Earth?,
 As far as I know, ozone has no effect. I am not familiar with the magnetic properties of ozone--how paramagnetic it may be--but you should realize that the total amount of ozone in the upper atmosphere 
is very small, less than 10 parts per  million of the atmosphere above 30 km (fig 10.2, p. 157, in the chapter on ozone of \The Upper Atmosphere and Magnetosphere\, Natl Acad. of Sci. 1977).,
   Ozone is not a recognized as a factor in any model of the Earth's distant magnetic field, whereas electric currents in the ionospheric E-layer (125 km) do play an important role there.,
 What would Earth be like if there was no magnetosphere or if the strength of the magnetosphere was decreased to the point the inner radiation belt was at the Earth's surface instead of a diameter away? 
,
   If the Earth had no magnetic field of its own but an atmosphere, the solar wind would hit the top of the atmosphere, create there a standing shock and then flow around. Much like the actual magnetosphere--but 
the obstacle would be much smaller, and of course, notrapped particles. That's the case with the planet Venus, ,
   If the Earth had no magnetic field AND no atmosphere, it would belike the Moon. The solar wind hits the Moon and is absorbed--but it is sorarefied that it does not make much of a difference. The interplanetarymagnetic 
field goes through the Moon as if it weren't there, because theMoon is an electric insulator--and you know well that a magnet can pull through a sheet of paper or other insulators. Further behind the Moonis 
a wake of sorts, because a \shadow cylinder\ there is left emptyof the solar wind (that's the part lost when it hit the surface) and like the eddies behind a moving truck, the gas from the sides gradually 
fills that space again. ,
   The lower limit of the inner radiation belt is set by the atmosphere.It ends gradually, where the density of air gets high enough, so that the lifetime of a trapped proton is not a year but a month, 
a week, a day or(if you go down further) even less. If no atmosphere existed, the protonswould hit the surface SOMEWHERE--usually, where the field was weakest--and the radiation belt would stop there. 
In other regions, where thefield is stronger, the lower boundary would be well above the ground.In the actual magnetosphere, the weakest field is above the southernAtlantic ocean, so that's where the inner 
belt may come down to, say, 600 km--but after that, collisions with the atmosphere quickly put a limit to it even there. ,
     FIRST: Since the magnetic field has continuous coverage -- there aremagnetic field lines coming up out of the poles, themselves, and so forthas you go down the latitude -- why is the aurora in the 
shape of sheetsthat make a rough ring around the magnetic pole, rather than being a sortof diffuse fog of color centered on the magnetic pole?,
     SECOND: suppose that a planet's rotational axis is parallel to the eclipticplane and one pole  is pointing to the sun, the other pole away from thesun, and that the planet has a magnetic field roughly 
polar along with therotational pole as our planet is, with the result that one magnetic pole isfacing towards the sun, rather than perpendicular to the sun as is the casewith earth.  Would this fact cause 
the planet NOT to have an aurora at thesunward pole, perhaps because the solar wind hitting it would so flattenthe magnetic field as to disrupt the aurora process?  What about theever-dark pole away from 
the sun: would it have an aurora?Thanks for your help!,
       The theory of such motions shows that (for energies low enough, such as those of the solar wind or of particles trapped in the magnetosphere) particles tend to spiral around field lines, and be 
guided by them like beads on a wire.  ,
       The light of the aurora is emitted when such particles--typically, electrons of 5-10,000 electron volts (wenpart1.html) hit the atmosphere, about 100 kilometers up.  The real question is--where 
do those electrons come from, and what gives them their energy? ,
        It stands to reason that if we follow auroral field lines outwards from the auroral zone, they should lead us to the source region.  In the absence of any external magnetic sources (i.e., the Earth's 
magnetic field is a \dipole\, like that of a short bar magnet), the closer one starts from the magnetic pole, the further do those lines lead us, and the field line from the pole itself would lead to infinity.,

       That was the reasoning of Kristian Birkeland, around 1895, based on his terrella experiment (whaur1.html). Birkeland believed auroral electrons came from the Sun (which is very distant), so the 
aurora should be centered around the magnetic pole, the way you argued in your message, and the way his terrella experiments showed.  He had an associate, Carl Stoermer, calculate those motions theoretically, 
reaching the same conclusion.  In Stoermer's book \The Polar Aurora\ (1956; he died a few years later) that was a major unsolved mystery.,
        We now know two possible reasons.  First, external magnetic field lines are deformed, so using a simple dipole model does not tell where they go, especially field lines near the pole. And second, 
auroral electrons (at least some) originate inside the magnetosphere, at distances of about 8-10 Earth radii, although they get most of their energy near Earth.  If you do take a dipole and trace on Earth 
the footpoints of field lines from those distances, you get about the right auroral zone. Sections 25-28 of \Exploration of the Earth's Magnetosphere\ have more details.,
       Your second question, about a \pole-on magnetic field,\ was topical around early 1986, when Voyager 2 approached the planet Uranus, because the rotation axis of Uranus at that time pointed just 
a few degrees off the direction of the Sun (see wotherms.html).  The prediction was a red diffuse aurora near the sunward pole, of the kind seen near the Earth's cusps, (wmpause.html) where a weak magnetic 
field lets the solar wind enter (no one was sure about what might happen on the night side). However, Uranus confounded predictions when it turned out that its magnetic axiswas inclined by 59° to its axis 
of rotation. As a result, the Uranus magnetosphere varies rather rapidly. It does hold some trapped radiation, and there is evidence of a weak aurora, located closer to the equator than Earth's. ,
     I have a question regarding how ions were discovered (around 1850s?). I searched through some undergraduate physics books, it is clearly stated  that the discovery of electron is attributed to J. 
J. Thomson in 1897. But it  is vague for ions. It was said that evidences accumulated around 1850s that ions exist, etc.,
      I am not sure whether he also gave the name--I was told it meant \wanderers\ and the Ionic tribes of early Greece were so named since they wandered into the country. (I was also told that \planets\ 
meant \wanderers\ as well; must ask someone Greek what the difference is.) Of course electrolysis was well known in 1850, but before Arrhenius, no one had a good explanation.,
       When Thomson discovered the electron in 1897, positive rays were already known, discovered by Goldstein in 1886 and sometimes called \kanalstrahlen\ (\channel rays\) because they could be extracted 
from a very narrow hole--channel--in the cathode (the hole couldn't be big because gas kept leaking from it, and even a narrow hole required constant pumping).  J.J. Thomson studied those rays in 1907-12, 
measured their charge-to-mass ratio or \e/m\ (students still do so in the lab) and laid the foundation to mass spectroscopy. See  http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/camphy/positiverays/positiverays1_1.htm,
        Yes, I have heard about it, but only from letters like yours.  Whichever way the story got started, it is false: I know of no magnetic problems in orbit, and of no artificial magnetic shields. 
 The,
      magnetic field sensed in Earth orbit is very weak, and I know of no magnetic effects.  Have you ever undergone an MRI scan--a medical scan using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine? You lie 
on a narrow pallet and are wheeled into the middle of a large magnet, with very intense field.  It's a noisy procedure, but you can sense no effect due to magnetism, because to the best of my knowledge, 
there is nothing in the human body affected by magnetism.,
     There is a man that advertises on Australian T.V. most weekdaymornings selling these magnetic blankets and all sorts of other rubbish.Your reply came in good time as I was about to give up.My intention 
is to write a dissection of his magazine called. \BiomagneticTherapy\ He claims to cure everything from Headaches to Osteoarthritis andCancer!  Bear in mind that I am not a journalist, Just someone who 
reads AustralianSkeptic,,
     Personally, I find that trying to discredit health claims of magnetism does no good.  People unfamiliar with physics do not realize that magnetism is well understood, and regard it as a mysterious 
force which can have unexpected results. Here in the US a brisk trade exists in magnetic bracelets and similar devices, and in Britain, many years ago, \Posigrade\ magnets were sold, to be attached to 
fuel lines of cars, supposedly to increase fuel economy.  All these are articles of faith, not science: write an article, if you want, but don't expect it to accomplish anything.,
     This brings to mind a story about the Nobel-winning Danish physicist Niels Bohr. Bohr had a cottage in the woods, and one day a visitor there noticed it had a horseshoe nailed above the door, a good-luck 
charm widely used in Europe.,
     My name is Steven and I'm taking a physics/electricity class in  school. I'm learning all about electricity! I'm so exited! Anyways, I got  to thinking about the huge power lines that are directly 
behind my house.  If the wires only \guide\ electrons along a path then could it be  possible to harvest the electrons that bleed from the lines to power a  TV? I thought of this idea and haven't been 
able to find any good  answers. I want to surprise my teacher for the science fair coming up with something really cool. Have you ever heard of such an idea?,
     If you could do it, it would probably be illegal.  It is not unheard of that people tap power lines (low voltage, not the biggies) by a secret copper wire--especially in the city, in poorly policed 
neighborhoods. It's against the law to take power without paying for it.,
       But you are safe. The air surrounding those lines is a very good insulator, and you cannot bleed electrons through it. Anyway, those lines run at very high voltage--that's to electricity like pressure 
to air and water. Any electricity tapped directly from them has probably enough voltage to burn out whatever you connect to it (yourself included, if you happen to put yourself in the circuit), just as 
connecting your bike tire to a source of 300 psi  (pounds per square inch) is likely to blow it to bits.,
        Science fair, huh?  Can you wire a board with 4 switches and one lightbulb, plus battery (wiring hidden below the board), so that when the light is off, any switch turns it on, and if on, any switch 
turns it off? You will need two 4-way switches and two 3-way switches--get them in the hardware store. It's a simple trick but it can mystify onlookers.,
     I know that a magnet loses its properties at a particular \Curie temperature,\ but we know that there is a very strong magnetic field around the sun, where the temperature is way beyond the Curie 
Temperature. So what is the reason behind suns magnetism ?,
       The magnetism of the Sun indeed used to be a great puzzle: not only was the Sun extremely hot, much hotter than any Curie temperature, but it was also a gas.  Yet sunspots were intensely magnetic.,

       Sir Joseph Larmor therefore proposed in 1919 that perhaps sunspot magnetism came from electric currents, driven by a \dynamo process\ by flows on the Sun (which is hot enough to conduct electricity). 
 Later the same idea was extended to the liquid core of the Earth, which is also hotter than any Curie temperature, but again, probably contains molten iron which conducts electricity.,
       The main collection there has elementary coverage of the dynamo process, but some greater details are in \A Millennium of Geomagnetism,\ also linked from the home page. As you will read there, the 
process for the Earth has now been successfully simulated on a computer, including polarity reversals. The polarity of the Sun's magnetism also reverses with the 11-year cycle.,
     I have searched the web for an explanation of what a \geomagnetic conjugate\is but haven't yet found anything particularly understandable. Possibly I havenot tried hard enough.  Do you have an explanation 
of this or a link to a sitethat I might understand? I am interested in monitoring \Natural Radio\. Thankyou.,
        As you will find by going through \Exploration of the Earth's Magnetosphere\ (see site map on the file you have cited), charged particles in the magnetosphere tend to be trapped on the same field 
line, and therefore conjugate points may be affected by the same population, e.g. by electrons released by a high altitude nuclear bomb. A bomb at one end of a line creates aurora at the conjugate point, 
as noted on the web page.,
       Certain types of waves also tend to be guided by field lines; these are essentially radio waves, modified by the presence of plasma in a magnetic field. Known as whistlers, such waves were originally 
detected as a whistling sound on long telephone lines--the lines acted as antennas, and since the frequency was in the audible range (2-4 Khz, typically), the telephone converted them to sound. Owen Storey 
in 1953 showed they were generated by lightning at the other conjugate point. The stroke of lightning creates a sharp pulse, but like any signal, this can be resolved as a sum of frequencies (Fourier spectrum). 
Whistlers differ from sound in that their different frequencies travel with different velocities, along their guiding field line, so they arrive spread out over a second or so, as a descending whistle. 
 Whistlers also get reflected by the ionosphere, so you can get several bounces of the same whistle, getting fainter with each hop.,
       Whistlers were the first solid information about electrons in space around Earth above the ionospheric density maximum--what is now called the plasmasphere--and were an important research tool for 
probing that region. Other emissions also exist, but mainly on field lines near the auroral zone. Prof. Robert Helliwell of Stanford University conducted extensive studies of these, especially using observations 
at Siple station in Antarctica and Roberval near Quebec, which are conjugate. The emissions are generated by unstable populations of trapped electrons, and Prof. Helliwell (whose work was continued by 
Umar Inan) also triggered them artificially.,
     These are phenomena of individual atoms, and at that scale, physics laws change to different laws, so-called quantum physics. What on our scale is smooth and continuous (e.g. the range of orbits allowed 
for a satellite) becomes choppy and discrete (e.g. range of orbits allowed to an electron in an atom). By those laws, even the pictures of an electron as a rotating charged sphere, or of an electron orbiting 
inside an atom, are not really right.  But they help our imagination get the main points right--such that electrons are magnetized.,
     One of the problems facing fusion in Tokamak-style plasma containment devices is the HUGE magnetic fields needed, then the instability of the plasma itself due to its own magnetic fields.,
     A possible example from nature may be the (slightly dubious) theories I have heard about ball-lightning being 'circular lightning' caused by 'eddy currents' from a lightning strike. Some have observed 
ball lightning with enough energy to melt glass that it had drifted through, and boil water, and even explode with enough force to flatten a house! They seem to have enough magnetic force to rip metal 
objects from their fixtures, yet are stable enough to remain intact for minutes. (I confess, I even saw one one hot summer's night when 15 years old or so!),
     I don't know, but wouldn't the magnetic field always be at right-angles to the moving ions, and thus they would stabilize each other, as long as the ions were always moving (and thus a current was 
moving)?,
        I once calculated such a field, which involves the same mathematics as Hill's spherical vortex in fluid dynamics.  I know this is mathematically far beyond your level, but let me just say that 
the result is given (including a term B1 which may be omitted) in problem 13, p. 17193, Journal of Geophysical Research, 1994. After deriving it I found that Harold Grad did so first, around 1958. It has 
field lines somewhat like the Earth's, confined in a sphere.,
       However, I think such a plasma needs an external pressure to keep it from dispersing, so it might not be a good model for ball lightning.  In fact, I vaguely recall a general theorem in mechanics, 
called the virial theorem, which states, roughly, that an independent mechanical system will not hold together unless the sum-total of attractive forces exceeds that of disruptive forces. \Sum-total\ here 
is taken over the space occupied by the system (e.g. interstellar cloud, planet etc.), with different regions weighed in some specific way, and the primary attractive force is usually gravity, while pressure 
and magnetic forces are disruptive.,
        The Earth's magnetosphere can be stable, since the main magnetic source is in the Earth's core, where gravity holds it together. Plasma in containment machines is kept in place by auxiliary coils, 
embedded in the machine (though I am not familiar with details). However a system which has only plasma (producing pressure) and magnetic fields will not stay together.,
        Ball lightning remains a mystery, its appearances are too brief and unpredictable for any meaningful study. I have not heard about it producing strong magnetic fields, although ordinary lightning 
certainly does. If ball lightning occurs immediately afterwards, magnetic effects may perhaps come from the primary stroke.,
      We had read about the magnetic storms and we had an idea, and hoped that you'd be able to shed some light.  We thought wouldn't it be terrific if we (humans) could harness the energy from the aurora 
to provide an unlimited source of energy, eliminating our reliance on foreign oil, etc.?  Crazy idea?,
          Our question is, what prevents us from doing this?  Is it too powerful to harness?  Do we lack the technology to harness it and if we had the technology, what  would it require? Why or why not 
could this be a possibility?  Thank you for any comments! ,
      Actually what you want to tap into is not the aurora but the large electric currents which accelerate the aurora and provide its energy--so called Birkeland currents which flow into the ionosphere 
from space and out again.  They can carry several millions of amperes at something like 50,000 volts, certainly a lot of power. See 25.Electric Currents from Space.,
         They are variable and erratic, but that is not their worst problem. First, the conducting layer of the ionosphere is separated from us by about 120 kilometers of air (70 miles). Over that distance 
the density of this air varies by a factor of a few million, but most of it is like air near the ground, a good insulator. Power companies string their cables through air with only negligible power leaking 
away. And anyway, no extension cord can reach so far. So we are electrically separated from the source.,
        Secondly, it is a very spread-out and diffuse current. To draw any serious amount of energy, one would have to connect to a huge area, many, many square miles.  We are only beginning to learn to 
extract power from sunlight, using solar cells, and their main problem is that sunlight is spread out so thinly.  Auroral currents, and the aurora itself, are spread out much more thinly than that.,
 There are many years I look forward info and details not only about the Van.Allen belt but about the probable effects on race characteristics of persons born and living in the areas where such belt lacks, 
as part of Brazil. Have you ever had interests connected to those effects?If not I apologize myself for daring contacting you ,
 The Van Allen belt does not seem to have any effect on people on Earth.  It does have a small magnetic field, but that is so small as to be lost among other fluctuations (and magnetic fields have no confirmed 
biological influence, anyway).,
        By the way, Brazil is probably CLOSER to the belt than most other countries, closer than the USA. It is near the magnetic equator, and the magnetic intensity around that equator is not constant 
but varies, because of irregularities in the structure of the field. Near Brazil that magnetic field is at its weakest. The Van Allen belt is centered above the magnetic equator, but it reaches lower down 
is where the field is weaker.,
       I hope you can help me.  I was just checking out your webpage and a question regarding the earth's Van Allen belts and solar flares/solar winds.  I read that the earth's magnetic field has actually 
weakened by about 7% and field's actual total energy measured is less by 14% (since 1829).  What is the impact of this weakening on the Van Allen Belts and the earth's Magnetosphere? ,
        If solar flare activity increases (e.g. second-biggest geomagnetic storm ever measured hit the earth about a week ago) and the earth's magnetic field weakens, what impacts would we observe inside 
the atmosphere?  Higher radiation exposure for folks on planes? Greater disruptions with electrical grids and radio transmissions?  What's projected in the long term? ,
        Can you recommend any websites that \a non-scientist lay person\ might be able to read up on this. I guess the late August solar flare activity had nothing to do with the New York blackout (it 
occurred 2 weeks earlier in August).  ,
 (1)           Trapped radiation is governed by the geomagnetic field. If you are below the belt (as in the international space station) or elsewhere outside its intense part, you should have nothing to 
worry about.  It could well be that the belt is now weaker than in the time of Gauss, 160 years ago, but that does not really change the preceding statement.  These ions have about 50 MeV.,
 (2)          Solar flares release unpredictable blasts of particles of higher energy, often 500 MeV and up to 10 GeV. In this case, people on the ground are still safe, because the atmosphere has enough 
thickness to stop the particles, equivalent to something like 4 meters of concrete. See the end of            http://www.phy6.org/Education/wsolpart.htmlIf you are in a spacecraft on your way to Mars, 
that can be dangerous. In Ben Bova's book \Mars\ this does happen, and astronauts have to hide in a protected area--behind fuel tanks, probably.,
        On Earth, we have an additional shield, the Earth's magnetism, which will deflect all but the highest energies from regions at equatorial and middle latitudes.  Jetliners crossing the polar region 
may perhaps find it useful to fly a little deeper in the atmosphere when the sun emits high-energy particles, and I heard the Concorde carried a radiation alarm. ,
       The magnetic field would have completely protected the space station in its originally planned orbit, inclined 29 degrees to the equator (latitude of Cape Canaveral). As it happened, this was later 
increased to about twice as much, to enable Russian launch sites to resupply the station (which turned out quite important after the \Columbia\ disaster). Twice each orbit, therefore, the station has relatively 
weak magnetic protection, near its closest approach to the magnetic poles.  I heard a rumor that during the 3 big flare events at the end of October 2003 the astronauts did in fact hide, but that is strictly 
hearsay which I cannot confirm. The even bigger flare on November 4 did not produce such a radiation surge.,
        I am not sure about disruption of power grids, but I think it arises when the auroral electrojets shift to lower latitudes during storms.  There are two large electric currents flowing along the 
auroral zone towards midnight, associated with the polar aurora (or more precisely, with the electric currents which produce big aurora; see in \Exploration of the Earth's Magnetosphere.\) Like any electric 
currents, they produce a magnetic field which can be observed on the ground, and which changes fairly irregularly.  ,
       When they move equatorwards, into more inhabited regions (and out of them again), the changing magnetic field induces electric currents in the high voltage networks there.  The induction is slow, 
so the transformers of the grid, configured to impede currents of 60 or 50 cycles/second, see essentially a DC current, to which they offer it no significant impedance, allowing it to grow big. Such a 
current can burn out transformers, unless appropriate circuit breakers are tripped in time. I don't know how serious that is: burn-outs happened in 1989, but as far as I know, not recently. ,
     I am not an expert in disruption of radio. Flares emit X-rays, which modify the ionosphere, adding ionization deeper down. It then can absorb certain frequencies, but I am not sure whether, say, cell 
phones are affected, or ships and airplanes.  I think the frequencies used by communication satellites are high enough to be immune, and of course a lot of land traffic these days uses optical cable. I 
am not sure about GPS.,
     These experiments are well known. Helliwell had a big wire antenna on top of the snow at Siple station in Antarctica (I believe that station no longer exists), and detectors at the other end at Roberval, 
north of Quebec. He indeed stimulated emissions, in frequency ranges close to those of atmospheric whistlers.,
       But don't get your hopes up for weather control or great energy release.  The reason he got such results was that the trapped electrons which produced those waves were already in unstable distributions 
and ready to let go.  It's a bit like those mortar shells rangers in Colorado and elsewhere fire into steep snowbanks, to release avalanches before anyone walks into them.  Those shells do not create avalanches, 
they only trigger them off. ,
       Similarly here, the signals trigger off a process which also occurs sporadically and naturally. The waves, typically 3 Khz (3000 cycles/sec) can be amplified and fed into a microphone, and the ear 
can then hear them, since sound in that range is audible.  One well known type of emission is known as \morning chorus\ because it resembles the twittering of birds sitting on a power line. Another emission 
in this range are \whistlers,\ products not of unstable electrons but of distant lightning. ,
     Thank you for such an in depth and informative Web Site. I have a  question about the force of the solar wind against the magnetosphere. If the  Earth's magnetosphere turned off (magnetic fields no 
longer existed on Earth),  how long could life on the Earth survive? Eventually the solar wind would  blow the atmosphere away. ,
     I don't have an exact answer, and it all depends on what you mean by \eventually.\ If the process happens it is probably too slow to make much difference.,
        Venus has no magnetic field, its gravity is less than ours and being closer to the Sun, it experiences a much stronger solar wind, yet it retains a dense atmosphere. True, because its atmosphere 
is so dense, it can suffer appreciable loss without much change.,
        I don't know what the loss rate is, but it could be calculated from observations downwind from Venus, and maybe someone has done so. I have found a long article (below) but it does not seem to 
give an answer         http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/interact_solwind/Another web page suggests little change in the atmosphere:           http://pauldunn.dynip.com/solarsystem/Venus_B.html 
,
     I'm trying to estimate parameters of a 50 keV electron's helical motion inthe aurora at about 100 km, assuming no collisions. (I'm just going tocalculate the radius, and distance traveled in one orbit.),

     The detail I can't seem to find is, very roughly, the Earth's magnetic fieldat that height above the poles. I'm guessing its not much weaker than it isat the Earth's surface, but I'm not sure.,
 where B is the field in Gauss (1 Gauss is the same as 100,000 nanotesla or nT), √ means square root and W is the kinetic energy in ev (electron volts) of the part of the motion perpendicular to the field 
line.  The field above the auroral region may be around  50,000 nT or half a gauss (negligible difference from ground level) so you get about 15 meters.,
     An energy of 50 keV is rather high for the aurora; 5 keV may be closer, the typical range is 1 to 15 keV.  And yes--auroral electrons arrive about evenly distributed in all directions (from above--not 
from below!) so your assumption of equal parallel and perpendicular components is reasonable.,
 I am wondering what is the importance of auroras in society.  I would alsolike to know what importance auroras have in the future.  I need to knowthis information for an essay I am writing.  I have searched 
everywhere butI haven't found any information on either of the two topics.  Please assistme.,
     I am curious--how did you come to write that essay? Your idea, or an assignment? If the latter, I wonder how other people with the same assignment are faring. By all means, send me your essay when 
it's done.,
       How important are auroras in society? One may just as well ask the same questions about rainbows, or bolts of lightning. All these started as a supernatural mystery--evidence that nature has strange 
wonders we do not understand, wonders which may be manifestation of some greater and more powerful intelligence, invisible but dominating our lives.,
       Gradually, they were explained, and are now viewed as evidence that nature is governed by orderly rules, and is not random or capricious. In fact, they help us learn about those rules. The fact 
that auroras are not completely understood shows we still have things to learn.,
       You write \ I have searched everywhere but I haven't found any information on either of the two topics.\ Where you lack information, try to think what the answer might be, and formulate your own. 
 Any good essay comes first of all from YOU.,
     The geomagnetic storms we have been experiencing cause me to have severe headaches and sometimes visual field aberrations, such as a flattening of my vision and depth perception, as well as some cognitive 
dysfunction. I have correlated these with the strength of the storms and flares by keeping a diary and checking it against the info put out by spaceweather.com on the daily email lists. My question is 
do you know of any way to counter act the effect of these ion storms on humans? I am aware of currently proposed research projects for shielding Cardiac ICUs since the storms are correlated with an increase 
in heart attacks. I have asked this of many doctors, both main stream and alternative practitioners. I always get a no but let me hear from you if you find out.,
       Have you ever undergone MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of your head? I have. First you must remove all iron objects from your pockets or body (watches, pens etc.), lest they fly off in the strong 
magnetic field and stick to the magnet. You then go to a room with a big doughnut-shaped machine, and lie on a pallet which wheels you into the hole of the doughnut, until your head (or other body part 
being examined) is in its middle. Then it scans you for a few minutes (you may not move, it's a time exposure) with a loud racket, and finally wheels you out again.  ,
       During those minutes your head may be exposed to 1000 gauss--maybe several thousand, I do not know the exact numbers. I never had a headache or sensed the magnetic field. But you may also ask operators 
of such machines (or search the web) to find more.,
       Effects similar to those of magnetic storms occur frequently in Fairbanks, Alaska, during \magnetic substorms\ accompanying the polar aurora. You may ask doctors in hospitals there if they find 
any effects. My guess is that they don't.,
       The answer is always--no. The radiation is bad, but not THAT bad. Astronauts went through the belt quickly, and the dosage was minimal. Two hours were certainly not enough to kill anyone--two weeks, 
maybe, I am not sure (the dosage to the skin would be heavy, but to the heart or brain much less so because most of the inner belt protons do not penetrate far).,
     High-energy ions from large solar flares can be very dangerous to humanlife. They can be quite penetrating and hard to shield against; \can be,\because the energies vary from event to event, and the 
size of a flare is onlyloosely related to the high-energy ion danger. ,
       Such flares occur infrequently, a few times each 11-year solar cycle, but if you send people to Mars, they pose a real risk (they also pose a risk on Mars itself, since the thin atmospherethere 
is not a very good shield).,
      We are students working on a science project involving magnetism. We are investigating what types of metals are attracted to magnets. Could you please send us your opinion on this subject along with 
any other information you may have.Thanks!,
      Iron is attracted to magnets, but why? Because near a magnet, in its \magnetic field\ (roughly, its region of influence) ordinary iron turns into a temporary magnet. See           http://www.phy6.org/earthmag/demagint.htmand 
then go to the page \Performing Gilbert's Experiment on Induced Magnetism.\,
        Many other materials are \paramagnetic\ and while they too turn into temporary magnets, these are very feeble, and are only weakly attracted. \Diamagnetic\ materials also turn into feeble magnets, 
but of opposite polarity, so these are slightly repelled.,
      I want to do an experiment of an aurora and all I can think to do isshow the similarity on magnet shavings and a magnet.  I feel this is a littlelame. Any ideas on how to be more effective.,
     I am in the 5th grade,  live in Charleston SCand love anything that deals with the sky. Auroras seemed to be a greatsubject to try to prove but after hours of research I can't find any way toreplicate 
one.  any help would be appreciated.  Thank you,
        The problem is that the aurora occurs high up, in very rarefied air, where the average spacing between molecules and atoms is large, so that an electron (like that of the aurora) has a long free 
run before it bumps into something.  Here at ground level the \mean free path\ (that is the technical term) is very short--less than the thickness of a hair.,
       Air is a poor conductor of electricity, which is why power companies string their lines through the air and never worry about electricity leaking away. To conduct electricity, it needs to contain 
a small percentage of electrons set free from their atoms. In the dense air we breathe, these bump into molecules so quickly that they almost immediately recombine, so at any time, hardly any are present 
(except with very high voltages, as in lighting).  ,
     But pump the air down to a few millionths or so of its ordinary pressure (just from memory, numbers need to be checked), and the picture changes. If the rarefied air is inside a glass tube, and you 
stick two wires into it (through holes with leakproof seals), then put a voltage of say 1000 volts between them, the air begins to glow. Now electrons have few collisions, and the voltage is enough to 
speed them up so that on colliding, not only do they not get lost, but they knock out some more electrons, so there are always enough of those to conduct a current.,
       Pump out more of the air, and the glow gets very dim--it's the collided atoms which emit light, and too few collisions take place (instead the electrons hit the wire at the positive end, which can 
get hot). This happens in X-ray tubes in the doctor'soffice, and in TV tubes. The glow can be deflected by a magnet which steers the electrons, but don't try it with your TV tubes because (1) their voltage 
is really high, (2) a magnet can defocus them permanently (3) their big shape is not good for reaching the electron beam inside and (4) you cannot see that beam anyway. Those beams are more like the aurora, 
though.,
      About 100 years ago a Norwegian physicist named Kristian Birkeland went one step beyond, simulating the aurora by sending a beam of electrons towards a spherical magnet in a vacuum chamber. Read 
about him in          http://www.phy6.org/Education/whaur1.htmlHis experiment however is quite difficult to duplicate.,
      I am dong a science project on Cosmic Rays. Ifound your site, or the site that some of your Research was on, and it wasreally interesting. I was wondering if it wouldn't be too much trouble foryou 
if you sent me some information about when those air balloons with thephotographic plates were sent into the atmosphere. I think that your work isamazing, thank you for all the help I've received from 
it so far. Thank you,
     High-altitude balloons with photographic plates were first sent up in the 1950s and 1960s, early days of cosmic ray research.  Part of the reason was not just to study cosmic rays, but also to investigate 
the collision of very energetic protons and ions with nuclei, which produced some interesting new short-lived particles and taught physicists about the way elementary particles were made. In those days 
cosmic rays were the only known source of such fast particles. In later years accelerator machines were built which produced such particles in much, much greater numbers, and those who study this sort 
of physics shifted to them.,
       High-altitude balloons are still used, but they now lift electronic instruments which automatically sort incoming particles--and being bigger than slivers of film scanned by a microscope, they also 
observe many more of them. Some of them are test-versions of instruments later flown aboard satellites.,
       The balloons contain helium, not air. When launched they look like long draggy bags, with a big bubble of helium on top, just enough to lift the payload in the dense atmosphere near the ground. 
At high altitudes, air is more arefied and much more volume is needed to lift the same weight. However, the bubble expands there and the balloon fills up to a near-spherical shape, supplying that lifting 
volume.,
      My wife is going to buy a mattress with built-in magnets (constant magnets with a diameter of a thumb's nail). Those things are advertised as health products. These built-in magnets should compensate 
for the decreasing strength of the earth's magnetic field.,
     1) If I believe those publications, the earth's magnetic field oscillates constant-periodically with 7.5 Hz. For my understanding, it's a constant field (no oscillation at all); it only decreases 
by time. What's your opinion?,
     2) The magnets on this mattress are attached in rows (magnet distance  ~10 cm). The following row is @ 30 cm distance, with all magnets in that row with reversed polarity So I have a couple of alternating 
N and S - pole rows from the top to the bottom. For my understanding, this doesn't reflect the earth's magnetic field and so the advertising argument, that this product does simulate/increase the earth's 
magnetic field once you're lying on the mattress. Does it sound logic to you?,
     3) These publications above also mention that applying a magnetic field inside a spaceship avoid from any loss of calcium in the astronaut's bones, and astronauts have less depressions, and mice don't 
loose their coat/skin anymore !? I thought the loss of calcium is due to the gravity and not to the fact that the astronauts are further away from the earth's magnetic field. What's your comment on this 
and are you aware of any experiments in manned space flight with applying magnetic fields to the ship?Thanks in advance for any helpful answers/comments.,
      (1)     I am not familiar with all the oscillations of the Earth's magnetic field--they exist, in various frequency ranges, but are always very small (and transient). You are right, the field is 
essentially constant.,
     (2)     No significant magnetic effects on human body have ever been found: we do not seem to have magnetic sensors (as homing birds might have), nor do any large currents flow in the body (if they 
did, they might respond to magnetic forces). Have you ever taken an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) test? I have--it's a rather noisy experience. You lie on your back on a narrow pallet which slides you 
in the middle of a ring-shaped magnet, and a field is switched on--I am not sure how strong, but probably a few thousand times the usual Earth's field. Before you go into the imaging room you are asked 
to remove all objects made of iron--key rings, watches, belts with buckles, etc.--lest they fly off and stick to the magnet. Yet while you lie on that pallet, you cannot tell the moment the magnet is switched 
on, or any difference when it is.,
       By the way, a movie is coming out, \The Core\, which seems to promote the notion that the Earth's magnetic field is essential to our well-being. Haven't seen it, but from what I have read, it seems 
to be sci-fi, not solid science.,
       Astronauts can lose weight in space (you are right about the cause), especially in long stays on a space station, but the remedy are exercises. I wrote about this in   http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Sskylab.htm,

      Sure, a Geiger counter can be used to locate missing objects--as long as they are radioactive. I read of prospectors using them in searching for uranium ore, at least early in the search (later more 
sensitive means are used). They are also used in security gates, to make sure no one is smuggling nuclear materials through them.,
       Such a counters were used at the gates to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where nuclear research is being conducted. One day a truck loaded with iron bars for construction work 
came in and the alarm started ringing. Sure enough, the iron was radioactive, and it turned out to have come from Mexico. Investigators tracked down its source and found that a medical machine containing 
a large radioactive source was illegally junked (the law requires all radioactive materials to be specially disposed) and ended up in a shipment of scrap iron, which was melted and turned into iron bars 
for construction. As far as I remember, no one was hurt that time, but inspectors had to track down all shipments of that iron, many of which ended in the US, and some buildings under construction had 
to be demolished and their iron removed.,
     Have we been able to determine if there is an induced voltage or modulationof the earth's magnetosphere at times when the other planets are at variousangles to the earth?,
        First of all, any effects of other planets existed would be more readily observed in interplanetary space outside the magnetosphere, rather than inside the magnetosphere, where  they would be muffled 
by the stronger magnetic fields and hotter plasmas, and obscured by unrelated waves and disturbances created there.,
       Second, the propagation of effects to Earth is dominated by the solar wind, flowing outward from the Sun, and to some extent by the interplanetary magnetic field. A planet upstream of Earth in the 
solar wind, or on the same interplanetary magnetic field line, might possibly affect us, but not otherwise.,
        Upstream we have only two planets, with relatively small wakes. The one of Venus is scarcely wider than the planet, since Venus has no magnetic field. Mercury has a field, but it is weak and the 
planet is small, so its wake is narrow, too. I am not aware of either wake being detected near Earth, but it is possible someone has observed one. The effect on Earth, in any case, is small.  About the 
effect of the Moon's wake, see next question below!,
      Jupiter has a giant magnetosphere and a huge wake, and I vaguely recall that wake being credited for a strange observation by a space probe near the orbit of Saturn, but of course Earth is upstream 
of the planet and the wake will never hit it. Jupiter's magnetosphere was also at one time given credit for energetic electrons (1 MeV or so) in the Earth's magnetosphere. It was claimed that those electrons 
were more plentiful at times when Earth and Jupiter were linked by the same bunch of magnetic field lines. However, I have not heard that explanation recently and believe most researchers now feel they 
are generated in our own magnetosphere--though the process responsible remains unclear.,
     What effect does our moon have on the solar winds? Could our moonact as a shield for the earth, from the full impact of the solar storm, whenit is upstream? Thank you.,
         Yes, when the moon is upstream of Earth it will intercept some of the solar wind which would otherwise impinge on the front of the magnetosphere. But the effect is small, because the moon is small, 
too. I have never read of anyone detecting it.,
       The radius of the Moon is about 1/3 that of Earth, whereas the radius of the magnetosphere abreast of Earth is about 15 Earth radii. If you take 10 Earth radii as the radius of the \front,\ you 
find the moon covers only 1/900 of the front area. A weakening of that extent in the flow of solar wind would be lost in the disorderly oise.\,
        Neither do I think that the moon casts a sharp (even if small) \solar wind shadow\ on the magnetosphere. At a distance of 60 Earth radii, it is about 180 moon radii away. Near the moon, on the 
side facing away from the Sun, the observed \shadow\ is sharp, but at a distance of 90 times the width of the obstacle I expect it to be washed out, especially since the bow shock of the Earth intervenes, 
with its disorderly \foreshock\ ahead and \magnetosheath\ behind.,
        Some people have claimed a correlation between  positions of the Moon and observed effects on Earth.  The position of the Moon does affect tides in the ocean, but one does not expect any magnetic 
effects.      ,
     As explained there, even though its name includes \sphere,\ the magnetosphere is far from spherical, and on the night side it extends well past the moon. Once a month the moon may spend about 2 days 
in the magnetotail region of the magnetosphere. ,
        Astronauts on Mars are more likely to freeze than to fry, because Mars is quite cold, being much farther away from the Sun. Cosmic radiation is a minor problem--it is fairly weak, and its danger 
may be small; its secondary particles produced in the atmosphere also reach us on the surface of the Earth, and though heavy nuclei among its primaries are biologically very damaging, their number is small. 
. The real problem are big solar outbursts, which happen (typically) several times each 11-year cycle of the Sun. They pose a danger not only during the flight there and back, but also on Mars itself, 
since its thin atmosphere (unlike Earth's) does not appreciably absorb high-energy solar protons.,
     (from reply to another message) The astronauts may have played the odds on their flight to the Moon. They might have had contingency plans we know not of, like huddling behind fuel tanks or (on the 
Moon) building a temporary radiation shelter. All this remains speculation: few flare events are intense enough to imperil life, and as it turned out, none materialized during the Apollo missions.,
     I just read your Solar Wind web article (Oct 2002).  I was trying to findthe speed of the solar wind when I found you article, and am emailing youwith that question.,
        The average solar wind moves at about 400 kilometers/second, a little more than 1/1000 of the speed of light--about 4 Earth radii per minute, about 4 days to cover the distance from the Sun to 
us. The magnetic field near the Sun may impede this motion; at times when the field lines linking the solar wind to its region of origin stick straight out (rather than bend around or arch back to the 
Sun), it gets a clear path and its velocity may rise to 700 km/s. At some other times its velocity may be only 300 km/s.,
        As eclipse photos have suggested, field lines above the poles of the Sun do stick straight out, and it was predicted that this sort of fast flow, which only occurs sporadically at the orbit of 
the Earth (mainly around years of sunspot minimum) should be the norm above the Sun's poles. When the Ulysses spacecraft passed above the polar caps of the Sun, that prediction was confirmed.,
     The word \radiation\ in common use has (unfortunately) more than one meaning. And to answer the 2nd question--no, microwave radiation and nuclear radiation (involving radioactivity) are very, very 
different.,
      \Radiation\ essentially means some effect which  spreads radially in all directions, along straight lines (along the radius).  Examples are light and its close relatives, infra-red (IR) radiation 
(emitted by hot objects) and ultra-violet (UV) radiation. ,
       In the middle 1800s James Clerk Maxwell concluded that light was an electromagnetic wave. That suggested such waves could be created by purely electrical means and in 1886 Heinrich Hertz did so, 
producing radio waves. The microwave radiation in your oven is also produced electrically, it is just a short-wave radio wave, developed in World War II for use in radar. When physicists talk of \radiation\ 
they usually mean \electromagnetic radiation,\ the large family covering light, IR, UV, radio and microwaves.,
       It was already known that in a glass tube containing very rarefied air and two separated electrical contacts, if a high voltage was connected to those contacts, an electrical current flowed and 
a faint glow was produced. [In 1897 J.J. Thomson found the current was carried by tiny pieces of matter, electrically charged, which were named \electrons.\] One of the discoveries of 1895, by the German 
Konrad Roentgen, was that the tube also emitted something that could fog photographic plates, even ones kept in tight dark boxes. Obviously some radiation was produced, and Roentgen named it \X-rays\, 
\X\ for \unknown.\,
       The same year the Frenchman Henri Becquerel found that uranium compounds also emitted some \radiation\ able to darken photographic materials. It thus seemed, at least  for a while, that Nature may 
have many other new types of radiation--in fact, some other claims were made (and later retracted), while science fiction writers had fun with stories about \death rays.\  ,
       Gradually a clear picture emerged. X-rays were part of the electromagnetic family, with very short wavelength and high penetration. Radiation emitted by radioactive materials was a mixture of 3 
kinds, one of them gamma-rays,  similar to X-rays, but usually with even shorter wavelength and greater penetrating ability. The other two were fast particles, atomic bullets which unlike electromagnetic 
radiation had mass--fast electrons (negative charge), and \alpha particles\, fast positive nuclei of helium.,
       Those particles should really not be called \radiation,\ but it is too late to educate the public, especially since many detector instruments (such as Geiger counters) respond both the particles 
and to X- or gamma rays. When James Van Allen's instrument on the \Explorer\ satellites I and III discovered high energy particles magnetically trapped in near-Earth space, they were called the \radiation 
belt,\ and the name stuck. To reduce confusion, perhaps it is better to call fast particles emitted by radioactive substances uclear radiation.\  ,
       Can you help me with this question?  How do make a container that can hold plasma? I am  9 years old.  I go to Scared Heart of Jesus. I have 4 sisters.  My dad works at N.T.I.A. and is also helping 
me.  Thank you.,
        With a rarefied plasma, one can continually supply fresh energy and  keep heating it up. This is what happens with a fluorescent lightbulb,  which contains plasma. The wires leading to the lightbulb 
continually  supply fresh electric energy, so the plasma is continually renovated,  which allows it to continue carrying an electric current.,
       The gas inside the lightbulb also absorbs energy from the plasma, and  emits it as light, which turns out to be a very efficient way of  producing light--more efficient than that of lightbulbs whose 
light  comes from a hot wire.,
       The other way is to use a strong magnetic force to keep the plasma  confined: this is made possible by the electrical properties of a plasma, which determine the way it interacts with magnetism. 
This is the way favored by researchers trying  to confine a dense plasma.  The plasma is inside some container, but the  magnetic \field\  (region of magnetic forces) keeps it from touching the  walls. 
The trouble is that this sort of situation can be very  unstable--the plasma also creates its own magnetic field, which modifies the one keeping it trapped, and so far, just when things get  interesting, 
it is likely to shake itself loose, slip away to the walls,  cool down and be gone.,
       A lot of clever physics has gone into this in the last 50 years, and  scientists have managed to trap denser and denser plasmas, but even now  they are a bit short of the temperature, density and 
trapping time which  would allow them to convert hydrogen to helium (nuclear fusion) and  create energy that way.  The Sun does release fusion energy, but it traps the plasma in its  core by its enormous 
gravity, which we cannot duplicate in the lab.    ,
      I noticed your web page on the GSFC site, with the reference to the early bomb tests, http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/whradbel.html . You mention the Soviet tests - but not the year in which 
they were conducted. Can you fill in the missing info?,
        The Soviets conducted three high-altitude tests above the Russian arctic region, on October 22, 28 and November 1, 1962. The first two were sub megaton, the 3rd in the megaton range. Unlike the 
US \Starfish\ explosion the preceding July, they were on field lines extending further into space, with less stable trapping, and they decayed within weeks. Interestingly, the US launched \Explorer 15\ 
on October 27, just in time to observe the resulting radiation belts. That satellite was built in response to the unexpected damage and longevity of the \Starfish\ belts. NASA engineers, under pressure, 
went into the \museum\ display in bldg. 1 of Goddard Space Flight Center, retrieved the engineering test model of Explorer 12 and converted it into a usable satellite, all in the record time of 91 days. 
I wish NASA still had that agility and in-house capability!,
        For further details and for references, see \The Radiation Belt and Magnetosphere\ by Wilmot Hess, published by Blaisdell 1968. Chapter 5 deals with artificial radiation belts, and the discussion 
of the Russian tests begins on page 172. The tests are listed in a table on p. 155, while decay times of radiation are given on p.200.     ,
      I live in Woodstock, GA, a suburban area of Atlanta.   We, in this area,have had some strange occurrences this year including an earthquake.  Itwas a small one, but since I am a native Georgian, 
and it was the firstI've experienced--the quake got my attention.  As a writer for a smallpublishing company, I like to record events like this as possiblematerial for later use.   ,
      To the point, I was told by a fellow worker  (a former teacher and fellowstudent in a Master's writing program at Kennesaw State University) thatthere would be an aurora borealis visible in the Georgia 
night skies onMay 30 and 31.  I looked for other sources to predict this unusualevent, but there was no mention of it anywhere else.  I looked, not toohard though since I suspected an urban legend in the 
making.  Pleasetell me, is it possible, ever, that an aurora borealis would appear thisfar south? ,
        It wasn't  a hoax, just perhaps wishful thinking. Eruptions on the Sun occur  now and then, some are quite big, and conditions may be ripe for a widespread aurora, yet often nothing happens.  How 
often have you heard  a tornado warning on the radio, but none materialized? A large flare on the Sun, a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) heading our way--all these are necessary, but until the disturbance 
actually arrives, who can tell if the interplanetary magnetic field is right (it should tilt southward, not northward), how big that CME actually is, and other imponderables?  The best a prediction can 
do is state a likelihood, never  a certainty (just as with a tornado).,
        Aurora may be visible from Atlanta,  but only rarely--perhaps once in a decade.  On 5 November 2001 aurora was widely seen across the lower 48 states; my son in Purcellville, Virginia, saw it (I 
looked but saw nothing--city lights may have blotted it out). I was alerted by a message from a family in Chicago and the story is on this web collection at wnovstrm.htm .  It may or may not have reached 
Atlanta, but a larger storm in March 1989 probably did get that far. For a picture of that storm from space (not at its greatest extent) see weather.html   on this collection of web sitesReportedly, the 
aurora following the great flare of 1 Sept. 1859--the first ever observed--reached Havana, Cuba.  About this solar event, see whcarr.html.Finally, for an overview about the polar aurora, see (also here) 
at aurora.htm   .,
 The use of single and dual frequency satellite radio navigation systems, like the Global Positioning System (GPS), has grown dramatically in the last decade. GPS receivers are now in nearly every cell 
phone and in many automobiles, trucks, and any equipment that moves and needs precision location measurements. High precision dual frequency GPS systems are used for farming, construction, exploration, 
surveying, snow removal and many other applications critical to a functional society. Other satellite navigation systems in orbit include the European Galileo system and the Russian GLONASS system.,
 There are several ways in which space weather impacts GPS function. GPS radio signals travel from the satellite to the receiver on the ground, passing through the Earth’s ionosphere. The charged plasma 
of the ionosphere bends the path of the GPS radio signal similar to the way a lens bends the path of light. In the absence of space weather, GPS systems compensate for the “average” or “quiet”  ionosphere, 
using a model to calculate its effect on the accuracy of the positioning information. But when the ionosphere is disturbed by a space weather event, the models are no longer accurate and the receivers 
are unable to calculate an accurate position based on the satellites overhead.,
 In calm conditions, single frequency GPS systems can provide position information with an accuracy of a meter or less. During a severe space weather storm, these errors can increase to tens of meters 
or more. Dual frequency GPS systems can provide position information accurate to a few centimeters. In this case the two different GPS signals are used to better characterize the ionosphere and remove 
its impact on the position calculation. But when the ionosphere becomes highly disturbed, the GPS receiver cannot lock on the satellite signal and position information becomes inaccurate.,
 Geomagnetic storms create large disturbances in the ionosphere. The currents and energy introduced by a geomagnetic storm enhance the ionosphere and increase the total height-integrated number of ionospheric 
electrons, or the Total Electron Count (TEC). GPS systems cannot correctly model this dynamic enhancement and errors are introduced into the position calculations. This usually occurs at high latitudes, 
though major storms can produce large TEC enhancements at mid-latitudes as well.,
 Near the Earth’s magnetic equator there are current systems and electric fields that create instabilities in the ionosphere. The instabilities are most severe just after sunset. These smaller scale (tens 
of kilometers) instabilities, or bubbles, cause GPS signals to “scintillate”, much like waves on the surface of a body of water will disrupt and scatter the path of light as it passes through them. Near 
the equator, dual frequency GPS systems often lose their lock due to “ionospheric scintillation”. Ionospheric scintillations are not associated with any sort of space weather storm, but are simply part 
of the natural day-night cycle of the equatorial ionosphere.,
 The electric power grid, and consequently the power to your home and business, can be disrupted by space weather.  One of the great discoveries of the 19th century was the realization that a time-varying 
magnetic field is able to produce an electrical current in a conducting wire.  The basic idea is that the time rate of change of the magnetic flux (i.e. lines of magnetic force) passing through a current 
loop is proportional to the current that is generated around the loop. A slightly earlier but equally important discovery was that a current-carrying wire produces a magnetic field.  The application of 
these principles is widely prevalent in modern society in electrical power generators, electrical power transformers, and electrical motors, for example.,
 Time-varying magnetic fields and electrical current systems are not just artificial phenomena, but in fact are quite common in nature too.  Natural electrical current systems which vary in time can be 
found inside the Earth, in the oceans, and in the upper atmosphere of the earth (above ~100 km) where the constituents of the atmosphere include positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons 
which move about in a myriad of complicated ways.  Many of these upper atmospheric current systems are constantly present and modulate in a regular way in response to the rotation of the earth, the gravitational 
pull of the moon, and the slow variation of solar radiation over the course of the solar cycle.  At times, though, these current systems can be greatly enhanced and exhibit rapid changes with time and 
space, a phenomenon typically referred to as a geomagnetic storm.  Geomagnetic storms in turn are caused by disturbances that propagate away from the Sun, travel through interplanetary space and interact 
with Earth’s space environment.,
 We might expect that the early inventors of the telegraph systems did not realize that the electrical circuit they were constructing was threaded by lines of naturally produced magnetic flux, and, even 
more surprising, that this flux could vary with time and induce a natural current in their system.  It was not too long after their deployment, though, that reports of anomalous currents were observed 
which could at times prohibit communication or could enable a system to be run without an electrical power source, or in more dramatic instances cause the recording paper to catch fire (see review by Boteler 
2003 and references therein).  Similar effects continued to be noticed from time to time with the next generation of communication lines (coaxial cables).,
 Another system of artificial electrical circuits began to grow with the advent of electrical power systems. Just like the telegraphs, this complicated collection of circuits is threaded by naturally produced 
magnetic flux and just like the telegraphs, rapid variations of this magnetic flux during geomagnetic storms causes a naturally produced current to flow through the system.  This effect was first reported 
after the 24 March 1940 geomagnetic storm (Davidson, 1940; see also Germaine, 1940 for reports of effects on long-line communication cables).  Numerous large and moderate impacts to the grid have been 
reported over the years, including a power blackout in 1958 (Lanzerotti & Gregori, 1986), equipment tripping and voltage stability issues (4 August 1972), a nine-hour blackout in Canada and a transformer 
loss (13 March 1989 - see photo), and a blackout in Sweden during the October 2003 storm. (See Boteler, 2001, for a comprehensive compilation of effects).,
 Assessing the impact of geomagnetic storms on the electrical power grid involves a number of considerations.  The path for current flow that responds to the varying external currents in the upper atmosphere 
follows artificial current paths on the ground (the power lines) as well as various natural current paths (e.g. conducting structures below the ground and nearby bodies of water).  Once the natural current 
paths are accounted for, the net geoelectric field that is imposed on the artificial current paths results in a quasi D.C. (periods of 10 seconds to 10’s (tens) of minutes) current in the power lines. 
 These geomagnetically induced currents cause the ‘exciting current’ in power transformers to operate out of their designed range, resulting in saturation of the magnetic core material inside the transformer. 
 Once the core saturates, the transformer no longer provides any back ‘electromotive force’ (a kind of electrical inertia) and the currents and voltages in the windings become abnormally large. Depending 
on the transformer design, this can lead to heating of the surrounding structures due to induced ‘Eddy Currents’ which has the potential to damage parts of the transformer.  An additional impact of transformer 
saturation is that the voltages and currents no longer have a simple sinusoidal (60 cycle) form and this can cause protective equipment elsewhere in the grid to trip when it shouldn’t.  These equipment 
‘trips’ can take needed equipment off line and cause voltage stability problems.  An additional issue for the system is that all of the transformers that are saturating show up as a significant inductive 
load on the grid as a whole.  This means that a system that is near peak levels of demand prior to the geomagnetic storm event may not be able to meet the total power demand when the geomagnetic storm 
occurs, leading to partial or system wide blackouts.,

 Coronal holes appear as dark areas in the solar corona in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft x-ray solar images. They appear dark because they are cooler, less dense regions than the surrounding plasma 
and are regions of open, unipolar magnetic fields. This open, magnetic field line structure allows the solar wind to escape more readily into space, resulting in streams of relatively fast solar wind and 
is often referred to as a high speed stream in the context of analysis of structures in interplanetary space.,
 Coronal holes can develop at any time and location on the Sun, but are more common and persistent during the years around solar minimum. The more persistent coronal holes can sometimes last through several 
solar rotations (27-day periods). Coronal holes are most prevalent and stable at the solar north and south poles; but these polar holes can grow and expand to lower solar latitudes. It is also possible 
for coronal holes to develop in isolation from the polar holes; or for an extension of a polar hole to split off and become an isolated structure. Persistent coronal holes are long-lasting sources for 
high speed solar wind streams. As the high speed stream interacts with the relatively slower ambient solar wind, a compression region forms, known as a co-rotating interaction region (CIR). From the perspective 
of a fixed observer in interplanetary space, the CIR will be seen to lead the coronal hole high speed stream (CH HSS).,
 The CIR can result in particle density enhancement and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength increases preceding onset of the CH HSS. As the CH HSS begins to arrive at Earth, solar wind speed and 
temperature increase, while particle density begins to decrease. After passage of the CIR and upon transition into the CH HSS flow, the overall IMF strength will normally begin to slowly weaken.,
 Generally, coronal holes located at or near the solar equator are most likely to result in any CIR passage and/or higher solar wind speeds at Earth. Strong CIRs and the faster CH HSS can impact Earth’s 
magnetosphere enough to cause periods of geomagnetic storming to the G1-G2 (Minor to Moderate) levels; although rarer cases of stronger storming may also occur. Geomagnetic storms are classified using 
a five-level NOAA Space Weather Scale. The larger and more expansive coronal holes can often be a source for high solar wind speeds that buffet Earth for many days.,
 Because of their potential for escalated geomagnetic activity and possible storming (G1 or higher), forecasters analyze coronal holes closely and also note them on the daily synoptic drawing. SWPC forecasters 
take into account any possible effects of CIR and CH HSS activity when forecasting the anticipated levels of overall planetary geomagnetic response for each 3-hour synoptic period over the next three days; 
as detailed in the 3-day forecast. Additionally, any predicted CIR or CH HSS influences are explained in more detail in the forecast discussion.,
 Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) are the slowly varying, highly energetic background source of energetic particles that constantly bombard Earth. GCR originate outside the solar system and are likely formed 
by explosive events such as supernova. These highly energetic particles consist of essentially every element ranging from hydrogen, accounting for approximately 89% of the GCR spectrum, to uranium, which 
is found in trace amounts only. These nuclei are fully ionized, meaning all electrons have been stripped from these atoms. Because of this, these particles interact with and are influenced by magnetic 
fields. The strong magnetic fields of the Sun modulate the GCR flux and spectrum at Earth.,
 Over the course of a solar cycle the solar wind modulates the fraction of the lower-energy GCR particles such that a majority cannot penetrate to Earth near solar maximum. Near solar minimum, in the absence 
of many coronal mass ejections and their corresponding magnetic fields, GCR particles have easier access to Earth. Just as the solar cycle follows a roughly 11-year cycle, so does the GCR, with its maximum, 
however, coming near solar minimum. But unlike the solar cycle, where bursts of activity can change the environment quickly, the GCR spectrum remains relatively constant in energy and composition, varying 
only slowly with time. (See Forbush decrease for short-term changes of GCR related to space strong solar events),
 These charged particles are traveling at large fractions of the speed of light and have tremendous energy. When these particles hit the atmosphere, large showers of secondary particles are created with 
some even reaching the ground. These particles pose little threat to humans and systems on the ground, but they can be measured with sensitive instruments. The Earth’s own magnetic field also works to 
protect Earth from these particles largely deflecting them away from the equatorial regions but providing little-to-no protection near the polar regions or above roughly 55 degrees magnetic latitude (magnetic 
latitude and geographic latitude differ due to the tilt and offset of the Earth’s magnetic field from its geographic center). This constant shower of GCR particles at high latitudes can result in increased 
radiation exposures for aircrew and passengers at high latitudes and altitudes. Additionally, these particles can easily pass through or stop in satellite systems, sometimes depositing enough energy to 
result in errors or damage in spacecraft electronics and systems.,
 The magnetic compass has been used for navigation for hundreds of years. At one time, it was the only reliable means of direction-finding on days when the sun and stars were not visible. Nowadays, sophisticated 
equipment is available that enables users to determine bearings accurately and to pinpoint locations to within a few metres. However, such equipment has not made the compass obsolete. It is still a very 
practical tool for navigation for many small craft and for people on foot. Even airplanes and ships equipped with more sophisticated equipment often carry compasses as backups.,
 Compasses come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on their intended use. The type of compass used on a ship or aircraft is a complex electronic or mechanical device capable of compensating for 
both the motion of the craft and its metallic structure. At the other extreme are small pocket compasses of low precision intended for casual use.,
 Regardless of their intended purpose or the complexity of their construction, most mechanical compasses operate on the same basic principle. A small, elongated, permanently magnetized needle is placed 
on a pivot so that it may rotate freely in the horizontal plane. The Earth's magnetic field exerts a force on the compass needle, causing it to rotate until it comes to rest in the same horizontal direction 
as the magnetic field. Over much of the Earth, this direction is roughly true north, which accounts for the compass's importance for navigation.,
 The horizontal force of the magnetic field, responsible for the direction in which a compass needle is oriented, decreases in strength as one approaches the North Magnetic Pole, where it is zero. Close 
to the pole, an area is reached where the frictional forces in the pivot are comparable to the horizontal forces of the magnetic field. The compass starts to behave erratically when the horizontal force 
falls below 6000 nT, and eventually, as the horizontal force decreases to less than 3000 nT, the compass becomes unusable.,
 These definitions are only guidelines, and experience has shown that with care, high quality mechanical compasses can be used, even in areas where the horizontal force is less than 3000 nT. Electronic 
compasses will operate regardless of the horizontal field strength. However, both mechanical and electronic compasses are subject to another problem within the area of compass unreliability - daily fluctuations 
in magnetic declination become increasingly large as one approaches the North Magnetic Pole. Where the horizontal force is less than 3000 nT, daily fluctuations in excess of 5 degrees are normal. Therefore, 
even if you compass is functioning correctly it may not be pointing where you think it is.,
 Navigating by compass requires determining bearings with respect to true or grid north (in the following we will assume grid north) from a map sheet and converting them to magnetic bearings for use with 
a compass. One way of doing this is given in the following steps.,
 Navigating by map and compass involves much more than simply converting bearings from true to magnetic. Anyone who plans to use a compass during a wilderness trip should read one of the many fine books 
that have been written on the subject. Some of these are listed in the references.,
 Although the Earth's magnetic field resembles that of a bar magnet we must find another explanation for the field's origin. Permanent magnets cannot exist at the temperatures found in the Earth's core. 
We also know that the Earth has had a magnetic field for hundreds of millions of years. We cannot, however, simply attribute the existence of the present geomagnetic field to some event in the distant 
past. Magnetic fields decay, and we can show that the existing geomagnetic field would disappear in about 15,000 years unless there were a mechanism to continually regenerate it.,
 Many mechanisms have been postulated to explain how the magnetic field is generated, but the only one that is now considered plausible is analogous to a dynamo, or generator - a devise for converting 
mechanical energy to electrical energy. To understand how a dynamo would work in the context of the Earth, we need to understand the physical conditions in the Earth's interior.,
 The Earth is composed of layers: a thin outer crust, a silicate mantle, an outer core and an inner core. Both temperature and pressure increase with depth within the Earth. The temperature at the core 
mantle boundary is roughly 4800° C, hot enough for the outer core to exist in a liquid state. The inner core, however, is solid because of increased pressure. The core is composed primarily of iron, with 
a small percentage of lighter elements. The outer core is in constant motion, due both to the Earth's rotation and to convection. The convection is driven by the upward motion of the light elements as 
the heavier elements freeze onto the inner core.,
 The actual process by which the magnetic field is produced in this environment is extremely complex, and many of the parameters required for a complete solution of the mathematical equations describing 
the problem are poorly known. However, the basic concepts are not difficult. For magnetic field generation to occur several conditions must be met:,
 All these conditions are met in the outer core. Molten iron is a good conductor. There is sufficient energy to drive convection, and the convective motion, coupled with the Earth's rotation, produce the 
appropriate flow pattern. Even before the Earth's magnetic field was first formed magnetic fields were present in the form of the sun's magnetic field. Once the process is going, the existing field acts 
as the seed field. As a stream of molten iron passes through the existing magnetic field, an electric current is generated through a process called magnetic induction. The newly created electric field 
will in turn create a magnetic field. Given the right relationship between the magnetic field and the fluid flow, the generated magnetic field can reinforces the initial magnetic field. As long as there 
is sufficient fluid motion in the outer core, the process will continue.,
    Earth's magnetic field (and the surface magnetic field) is approximately a magnetic dipole, with the magnetic field S pole near the Earth's geographic north pole (see Magnetic North Pole) and the other 
magnetic field N pole near the Earth's geographic south pole (see Magnetic South Pole). This makes the compass usable for navigation. The cause of the field can be explained by dynamo theory. A magnetic 
field extends infinitely, though it weakens with distance from its source. The Earth's magnetic field, also called the geomagnetic field, which effectively extends several tens of thousands of kilometres 
into space, forms the Earth's magnetosphere. A paleomagnetic study of Australian red dacite and pillow basalt has estimated the magnetic field to be at least 3.5 billion years old.[1][2]   ,
    Earth is largely protected from the solar wind, a stream of energetic charged particles emanating from the Sun, by its magnetic field, which deflects most of the charged particles. Some of the charged 
particles from the solar wind are trapped in the Van Allen radiation belt. A smaller number of particles from the solar wind manage to travel, as though on an electromagnetic energy transmission line, 
to the Earth's upper atmosphere and ionosphere in the auroral zones. The only time the solar wind is observable on the Earth is when it is strong enough to produce phenomena such as the aurora and geomagnetic 
storms. Bright auroras strongly heat the ionosphere, causing its plasma to expand into the magnetosphere, increasing the size of the plasma geosphere, and causing escape of atmospheric matter into the 
solar wind. Geomagnetic storms result when the pressure of plasmas contained inside the magnetosphere is sufficiently large to inflate and thereby distort the geomagnetic field.   ,
    The solar wind is responsible for the overall shape of Earth's magnetosphere, and fluctuations in its speed, density, direction, and entrained magnetic field strongly affect Earth's local space environment. 
For example, the levels of ionizing radiation and radio interference can vary by factors of hundreds to thousands; and the shape and location of the magnetopause and bow shock wave upstream of it can change 
by several Earth radii, exposing geosynchronous satellites to the direct solar wind. These phenomena are collectively called space weather. The mechanism of atmospheric stripping is caused by gas being 
caught in bubbles of magnetic field, which are ripped off by solar winds.[3] Variations in the magnetic field strength have been correlated to rainfall variation within the tropics.[4]   ,
    Often, a magnetic (dip) pole is viewed as a point on the Earth's surface where the magnetic field is entirely vertical. Another way of saying this is that the inclination of the Earth's field is 90° 
at the North Magnetic Pole and -90° at the South Magnetic Pole. At a magnetic pole, a compass held in the horizontal plane points randomly, while otherwise it points nearly to the North Magnetic Pole or 
away from the South Magnetic Pole, though local deviations exist. The two poles wander independently of each other and are not at directly opposite positions on the globe. Magnetic dip pole can migrate 
rapidly, observation of up to 40 km per year have been made for the North Magnetic Pole[6].   ,
    The Earth's magnetic field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned near the centre of the Earth. A dipole's orientation is defined by an axis. The two positions where 
the axis of the dipole that best fits the geomagnetic field intersect the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. For best fit the dipole representing the geomagnetic field should 
be placed about 500 km off the center of the Earth. This causes the inner radiation belt to skim lower in Southern Atlantic ocean, where the surface field is the weakest, creating what is called the South 
Atlantic Anomaly.   ,
    If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic and magnetic dip poles would coincide. However, significant non-dipolar terms in an accurate description of the geomagnetic field 
cause the position of the two pole types to be in different places.   ,
    The strength of the field at the Earth's surface ranges from less than 30 microteslas (0.3 gauss) in an area including most of South America and South Africa to over 60 microteslas (0.6 gauss) around 
the magnetic poles in northern Canada and south of Australia, and in part of Siberia. The average magnetic field strength in the Earth's outer core was measured to be 25 Gauss, 50 times stronger than the 
magnetic field at the surface.[9][10]   ,
    The field is similar to that of a bar magnet. The Earth's magnetic field is mostly caused by electric currents in the liquid outer core. The Earth's core is hotter than 1043 K, the Curie point temperature 
above which the orientations of spins within iron become randomized. Such randomization causes the substance to lose its magnetization.   ,
    Convection of molten iron within the outer liquid core, along with a Coriolis effect caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize these \electric currents\ in rolls aligned along the 
north-south polar axis. When conducting fluid flows across an existing magnetic field, electric currents are induced, which in turn creates another magnetic field. When this magnetic field reinforces the 
original magnetic field, a dynamo is created that sustains itself. This is called the Dynamo Theory and it explains how the Earth's magnetic field is sustained.   ,
    Another feature that distinguishes the Earth magnetically from a bar magnet is its magnetosphere. At large distances from the planet, this dominates the surface magnetic field. Electric currents induced 
in the ionosphere also generate magnetic fields. Such a field is always generated near where the atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations that can deflect surface magnetic fields by 
as much as one degree. Typical daily variations of field strength are about 25 nanoteslas (nT) (i.e. ~ 1:2,000), with variations over a few seconds of typically around 1 nT (i.e. ~ 1:50,000).[11]   ,
    Magnetometers detect minute deviations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by iron artifacts, kilns, some types of stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using 
magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. The basalt — the 
iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners as early 
as the late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean 
floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.   ,
    Recently, leaks have been detected in the magnetic field, which interact with the Sun's solar wind in a manner opposite to the original hypothesis. During solar storms, this could result in large-scale 
blackouts and disruptions in artificial satellites.[14]   ,
    Based upon the study of lava flows of basalt throughout the world, it has been proposed that the Earth's magnetic field reverses at intervals, ranging from tens of thousands to many millions of years, 
with an average interval of approximately 300,000 years.[15] However, the last such event, called the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, is observed to have occurred some 780,000 years ago.   ,
    There is no clear theory as to how the geomagnetic reversals might have occurred . Some scientists have produced models for the core of the Earth wherein the magnetic field is only quasi-stable and 
the poles can spontaneously migrate from one orientation to the other over the course of a few hundred to a few thousand years. Other scientists propose that the geodynamo first turns itself off, either 
spontaneously or through some external action like a comet impact, and then restarts itself with the magnetic \North\ pole pointing either North or South. External events are not likely to be routine causes 
of magnetic field reversals due to the lack of a correlation between the age of impact craters and the timing of reversals. Regardless of the cause, when the magnetic pole flips from one hemisphere to 
the other this is known as a reversal, whereas temporary dipole tilt variations that take the dipole axis across the equator and then back to the original polarity are known as excursions.   ,
    Studies of lava flows on Steens Mountain, Oregon, indicate that the magnetic field could have shifted at a rate of up to 6 degrees per day at some time in Earth's history, which significantly challenges 
the popular understanding of how the Earth's magnetic field works.[16]   ,
    Paleomagnetic studies such as these typically consist of measurements of the remnant magnetization of igneous rock from volcanic events. Sediments laid on the ocean floor orient themselves with the 
local magnetic field, a signal that can be recorded as they solidify. Although deposits of igneous rock are mostly paramagnetic, they do contain traces of ferri- and antiferromagnetic materials in the 
form of ferrous oxides, thus giving them the ability to possess remnant magnetization. In fact, this characteristic is quite common in numerous other types of rocks and sediments found throughout the world. 
One of the most common of these oxides found in natural rock deposits is magnetite.   ,
    As an example of how this property of igneous rocks allows us to determine that the Earth's field has reversed in the past, consider measurements of magnetism across ocean ridges. Before magma exits 
the mantle through a fissure, it is at an extremely high temperature, above the Curie temperature of any ferrous oxide that it may contain. The lava begins to cool and solidify once it enters the ocean, 
allowing these ferrous oxides to eventually regain their magnetic properties, specifically, the ability to hold a remnant magnetization. Assuming that the only magnetic field present at these locations 
is that associated with the Earth itself, this solidified rock becomes magnetized in the direction of the geomagnetic field. Although the strength of the field is rather weak and the iron content of typical 
rock samples is small, the relatively small remnant magnetization of the samples is well within the resolution of modern magnetometers. The age and magnetization of solidified lava samples can then be 
measured to determine the orientation of the geomagnetic field during ancient eras.   ,
    The Earth's magnetic field strength was measured by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1835 and has been repeatedly measured since then, showing a relative decay of about 10% over the last 150 years. [17] The 
Magsat satellite and later satellites have used 3-axis vector magnetometers to probe the 3-D structure of the Earth's magnetic field. The later Ørsted satellite allowed a comparison indicating a dynamic 
geodynamo in action that appears to be giving rise to an alternate pole under the Atlantic Ocean west of S. Africa.[18]   ,
    Governments sometimes operate units that specialise in measurement of the Earth's magnetic field. These are geomagnetic observatories, typically part of a national Geological Survey, for example the 
British Geological Survey's Eskdalemuir Observatory. Such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions that sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other human activities. (See 
magnetic storm.)   ,
    The military determines local geomagnetic field characteristics, in order to detect anomalies in the natural background that might be caused by a significant metallic object such as a submerged submarine. 
Typically, these magnetic anomaly detectors are flown in aircraft like the UK's Nimrod or towed as an instrument or an array of instruments from surface ships.   ,
    Animals including birds and turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, and use the field to navigate during migration.[19] Cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing, 
but not when the animals are under high voltage power lines, leading researchers to believe magnetism is responsible.[20][21]   ,
 This introduction to geomagnetism is from \Magnetic monitoring of earth and space\ (PDF) by Jeffrey Love, published in Physics Today 61, 2, 31 (2008). (Note that figure 3 of this version and the downloadable 
PDF has been modified and corrected from the Physics Today version.),
 For centuries, navigators of the world’s oceans have been familiar with an effect of Earth’s magnetic field: It imparts a directional preference to the needle of a compass. Although in some settings magnetic 
orientation remains important, the modern science of geomagnetism has emerged from its romantic nautical origins and developed into a subject of great depth and diversity. The geomagnetic field is used 
to explore the dynamics of Earth’s interior and its surrounding space environment, and geomagnetic data are used for geophysical mapping, mineral exploration, risk mitigation, and other practical applications. 
A global distribution of ground-based magnetic observatories supports those pursuits by providing accurate records of the magnetic-field direction and intensity at fixed locations and over long periods 
of time.,
 Magnetic observatories were first established in the early 19th century in response to the influence of Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss. Since then, magnetic measurement has advanced significantly, 
progressing from simple visual readings of magnetic survey instruments to include automatic photographic measurement and modern electronic acquisition. To satisfy the needs of the scientific community, 
observatories are being upgraded to collect data that meet ever more stringent standards, to achieve higher acquisition frequencies, and to disseminate data in real time.,
 To appreciate why data from magnetic observatories can be used for so many purposes, one needs only to recall that the geomagnetic field is a continuum, connecting the different parts of Earth to each 
other and to nearby space. Beneath our feet and above our heads, electric currents generate magnetic fields that contribute to the totality of the geomagnetic field measured at an observatory on Earth’s 
surface. The many physical processes that operate in each geophysical domain give rise to a complicated field that exhibits a wide variety of time-dependent behavior. In this article I review the status 
of the global community of magnetic observatories, show how Earth and space can be monitored for purposes of scientific understanding and practical application, and highlight the role played by magnetic 
observatories in the history of geomagnetism research.,
 To support a wide range of geophysical studies, magnetic observatories such as that shown in figure 1 need to produce accurate measurements of the geomagnetic field over a wide range of time scales. The 
longest time scale is defined by the lifetime of the observatory. Naturally, that depends on many practical factors, including long-term funding and staffing. Some observatories operate for only a few 
years, but others, such as the Sodankylä Geophysical Observatory in Finland and the Apia Observatory in Samoa, have operated continuously for well over a century. The shortest time scale of relevance is 
the time between sequential measurements. Older analog photographic systems typically produce data with a one-hour cadence. Modern digital systems provide data at much higher acquisition rates. These days, 
one-minute-average data is a standard observatory product, but one-second-average data production is becoming more common. As an example, the Kakioka Magnetic Observatory in Japan has produced one-second 
data continuously since 1983—a record of magnetic-field variation over time scales spanning almost nine orders of magnitude.,
 To reliably produce a long-period geomagnetic time series, an observatory must operate under carefully controlled conditions. Typically, the site of an observatory is large enough to isolate the measurements 
from most sources of anthropogenic magnetic interference, and many observatories are in relatively remote locations. Buildings on the site provide stable operating conditions for the sensors, calibration 
systems, and associated instrument and data-acquisition electronics.,
 A modern observatory has a fluxgate magnetometer, which gives vectorial data conventionally expressed in terms of either the Cartesian components (X [north], Y [east], and Z [down]) or the horizontal–polar 
components (horizontal intensity \\(H=[X^2+Y^2]^{1/2}\\) , declination D = arctan[Y/X], and Z [down]). Note that declination is the direction in which a compass needle points. More formally, it is the 
angle of the direction of the magnetic field’s horizontal component. A well-run observatory will produce fluxgate data that show little drift in accuracy–usually less than 20 nanotesla annually. For many 
real-time nonresearch applications, that standard of accuracy is sufficient.,
 But more stringent ionospheric and magnetospheric research projects, as well as long-term mapping of the global magnetic field,require more accurate data. For that reason a modern magnetic observatory 
has a proton precession magnetometer that measures the total absolute field intensity \\(F=(X^2+Y^2+Z^2)^{1/2}\\). An observatory also has a pier-mounted theodolite, a familiar surveying instrument, but 
one having a small fluxgate fixed to its telescope.About once a week, an observer visits the site and makes a series of measurements using the theodolite to obtain D and the inclination I= arctan(Z/H). 
Those absolute magnetic-direction data are then used to calibrate the fluxgate data, so as to compensate for long-term drift in the fluxgate magnetometer. Production of definitive observatory data involve 
processing. The resulting data have an absolute accuracy of better than 5 nT, which permits meaningful analysis of magnetic variation that can occur over time scales ranging from the acquisition cadence 
out to the observatory’s lifetime.,
 Fluxgate magnetometers and proton precession magnetometers are the two types most commonly used in magnetic observatories. The Quick Study by Uli Auster on Physics Today 0031-9228 61 2 2008 76 (page 76) 
describes how they work and includes a photo of a theodolite with fluxgate.,
 Approximately 170 magnetic observatories operate worldwide. Most are supported by national governments, some by universities, and a few by private companies. During the International GeophysicalYear in 
1957–58, many new observatories were established as part of a coordinated effort to enhance the global collection of geophysical data, and many existing observatories were improved (see the article by 
Fae L. Korsmo, Physics Today, Physics Today 0031-922860 7 2007 38, July 2007, page 38). Today about 120 observatories produce and routinely report digital data with an acquisition cadence of one minute 
or better; figure 2 shows where they are located around the globe. The remaining 50 or so observatories use older, analog systems or report their data only years after acquisition. Note that the geographic 
distribution of observatories is far from uniform, with a general sparsity in, for example, the Southern Hemisphere and in the central Pacific. To promote observatory operation according to consistent 
standards and to facilitate the prompt dissemination of digital data, the international observatory network organization Intermagnet was formed in 1987. As of January 2008, 42 countries and 108 observatories 
participate in and follow the modern standards set by Intermagnet.,
 Ground-based fluxgate networks, sometimes called variometer networks, and satellite-based magnetometers fill niches that are complementary to that filled by the observatories. Most fluxgate networks are 
maintained by universities and various national governmental programs; they typically operate for a few years for space-physics research. Because of their more specialized nature, the networks do not need 
the laborious standards adopted by full-fledged magnetic observatories. Satellite magnetometers measure the part of Earth’s magnetic field that is in space; over the course of many orbits, they can provide 
good global coverage, albeit from only a relatively small number of locations at any particular time.,
 In the future almost all users of observatory data will expect greater accuracy, and many will require real-time magnetic-observatory data streams and easier access to data from all parts of the globe. 
Demand for higher-frequency data acquisition will increase, especially from space physicists. To meet those needs, the international programs that support magnetic observatories will have to be even better 
integrated than they are today. Older observatories will need to be modernized and all parts of observatory operations made more automatic.,
 How do geophysicists interpret the abundance of magnetic-observatory data? To answer that question, let us take a tour of magnetic signals. The tour begins deep inside Earth, in the iron core where the 
majority of the geomagnetic field originates. From there, we trace the magnetic field up to the surface, where the observatories are located. Next, we continue onward and upward through the ionosphere 
to the magnetosphere. The physics encompassed in the tour is classical and includes electricity and magnetism, fluid mechanics, and plasma dynamics.,
 Earth’s core lies some 2900 km below the surface. In the outer part of the core, a combination of thermal and chemical buoyancy sustains convective fluid motion and establishes what is essentially a naturally 
occurring electrical generator. As the electrically conducting core fluid flows through the geomagnetic field, motional induction generates electric currents. Those currents, in turn, generate their own 
magnetic fields. If it is sufficiently complicated—lacking simple symmetry—the magnetic field that partakes in the motional induction is the same field that is sustained by the induced electric currents. 
The process is efficient enough to overcome the effects of ohmic dissipation, and so Earth’s core is a self-sustaining dynamo. The mathematics of the geodynamo is sometimes described as being a bit like 
that of oceanography and meteorology, but with the additional complication presented by the magnetic field itself. Scientists still don’t know or understand many things about dynamo theory; not surprisingly, 
it is the subject of ongoing research (see the article by Raymond Jeanloz and Barbara Romanowicz, Physics Today, Physics Today 0031-9228 60 8 1997 22, August 1997, page 22 ).,
 Part of the magnetic field generated in the core extends outward, passes through the weakly electrically conducting mantle, and reaches the surface. The field at Earth’s surface typically has an intensity 
of 30 000–60 000 nT and is approximately dipolar, with an axis tilted by about 10&deg; with respect to Earth’s rotational axis. But the magnetic field also has important ingredients that are nondipolar. 
One way to appreciate that is to make a map of declination. The compass needle aligns itself with the horizontal direction of the local magnetic field. As figure 3(a) shows, a compass needle almost never 
points due north. Indeed, because of the nondipolar field, declination is a complicated function of latitude and longitude. As a result of core convection, the magnetic field also exhibits secular variation 
over time scales of decades to millions of years. And so, at a given location, the direction that a compass points changes over time. The two maps of declination in figure 3(a) show the progression of 
geomagnetic secular variation over the past century. Indeed, because the field changes in time, maps of it are updated every five years or so.,
 Figure 3(b) shows year-to-year differences in declination measuredduring the 20th century from five different observatories. The secular variation not only is different in different locations but also 
occasionally accelerates. An interesting feature of the data is the apparent presence around 1970 of a discontinuous change, or jerk, in the rate of secular variation. Jerks are clearly seen in the European 
and Australian data. On the other hand, a jerk isn’t obvious in the Japanese data. And although the Alaskan data show a jerk, it is of the opposite sign of that for Europe and Australia.,
 Clearly, a global description of the secular variation is complicated. Still, geophysicists have made progress in relating jerks and secular variation to decade-scale changes in Earth’s rotational rate 
that arise from exchanges of angular momentum between the core and mantle. With certain assumptions, core angular momentum can be deduced from geomagnetic secular variation models. Then, assuming that 
Earth’s total angular momentum is conserved, one can estimate the changes that should have occurred in the mantleangular momentum over the past century or so. Predicted variations in the length of a day 
are close to those actually observed, and that gives researchers some confidence that their theories are reasonable.,
 Time-dependent magnetic-field variations sustained by currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere induce electric currents in the crust, ocean, and mantle. Those currents, in turn, generate internal 
magnetic fields. The skin depth to which the induced currents diffusively penetrate is a function of Earth’s subsurface electrical conductivity and the frequency of the overhead magnetic-field variations. 
So, for example, magnetic variations with periods ranging from a second to tens of minutes penetrate into the crustsome 20–100 km. An observatory, of course, measures the total magnetic field, a superposition 
of the external, inducing field and the internal, induced field. Mathematical separation of the two requires a large number of simultaneous measurements, densely distributed across Earth’s surface; it 
is a task not ideally suited to the relatively sparse distribution of magnetic observatories. For that reason, detailed regional studies of Earth’s conductivity structureoften involve the deployment of 
temporary arrays of sensors to measure both the magnetic field at Earth’s surface and the induced electric field in the crust.,
 Qualitative insight into geomagnetic induction can be obtained through direct inspection of observatory data. Figure 4 shows magnetograms from four European observatories that recorded a large magnetic 
storm. Each observatory shows a similar variation in H. Most of that is the magnetic signature of a large-scale, overhead ionospheric and magnetospheric current system sustained during the storm.,
 In contrast, the magnetogram traces in Z vary significantly from site to site, due to localized subsurface differences in electrical conductivity in the vicinity of each observatory. Note, for example, 
the Z traces for the two Spanish observatories: San Pablo Toledo (SPT), in the center of Spain, and Ebro (EBR), on the coast. Much of the variation in Z reflected in the Ebro magnetogram comes from electric 
currents induced in the Mediterranean Sea. Since oceanwater is a good electrical conductor compared with dry rock and hydrated sediments, the nearby coastal inlets and sea-depth variations establish a 
local conductivity heterogeneity; the result is the complicated electromagnetic response seen in the data. on the other hand, differences in Z variation between the Italian and Romanian observatories are 
related to local geology. Both areas are tectonically complicated, but the formation of the Carpathian Mountains created a zone of active rock metamorphism and unusually high electrical conductivity that 
is manifested in the complexity of the lowest trace.,
 Above Earth’s surface the magnetic field threads its way through the ionosphere, the electrically conducting part of the upper atmosphere where solar radiation maintains partial ionization. The degree 
of ionization is a function of altitude, latitude, time of day, season, and solar-cycle phase. At altitudes of 90–300 km or so, winds driven by day–night temperature differences and tides driven by the 
gravity of the Moon and Sun sustain motional induction. During quiet times, when the magnetic field is relatively undisturbed by solar activity, the electric currents of the ionospheric dynamo give a distinct 
diurnal variation to observatorymagnetograms, as evidenced in figure 5(a). A detailed Fourier analysis of longer time series reveals frequencies corresponding to coupled modulations driven by the solar 
cycle, Earth’s orbit around the Sun, the Moon’s orbit around Earth, and Earth’s rotation. Through application of Ampère’s law, the corresponding ionospheric currents can be mapped; figure 5(b) reveals 
that the quiet-time current system is dominated by two day-side current gyres. Earth’s rotation under that current system gives rise to the quiet-time daily variation of the magnetic field.,
 Prominent in figure 5(a) is the daily variation in the magnetogram from Huancayo, Peru. First observed in the 1920s, soon after the Carnegie Institution of Washington established the Huancayo observatory, 
the variation is the result of the ionosphere’s anisotropic electrical conductivity. on Earth’s day side, in a roughly 5&deg;-wide band near the magnetic equator, the horizontal ambient magnetic field 
and a vertical electrical field maintained by charge separation across the thickness of the ionosphere combine to facilitate the east–west motion of charge carriers. That gives a concentrated flow of daytime 
electric current toward the east and the observed enhancement of diurnal magnetic variation at observatories like Huancayo that are located very close to the magnetic equator.,
 The extent of the geomagnetic field in near-Earth space defines the magnetosphere (see references 7 and 9 and the article by Syun-Ichi Akasofu and Louis J. Lanzerotti, Physics Today, Physics Today 0031-9228 
28 12 1975 28, December 1975, page 28). The shape of the magnetosphere, depicted in figure 6(a), is determined by a supersonic solar wind of electrons and ionized hydrogen and helium that moves at speeds 
of 250–2000 km/s. Inside a resulting shock wave, the magnetic field of the magnetosphere on the Sun side is compressed, with a “magnetopause” at about 10 Earth radii (10 R ⊕). On the opposite, night side, 
the magnetosphere is drawn out into a long tail whose length can exceed 100 R ⊕.,
 One can also describe the magnetosphere in terms of its constituent electric currents. The magnetopause is then defined by a surrounding current that flows eastward near the equatorial plane. The magnetotail 
can be defined in terms of a westward equatorial current sheet. The magnetospheric interior within about 3–6 R ⊕ contains a neutral plasma of 1- to 200-keV hydrogen and oxygen ions and lower-energy electrons. 
Those particles undergo a complicated dance consisting of cyclotron motion around magnetic-field lines, bounces between mirror points in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres where field lines converge, 
and a slow migration across field lines due to gradients in the magnetic field. The net result is that ions tend to drift westward and electrons eastward, a contrary motion that gives rise to a westward 
equatorial ring current.,
 Along with the solar wind, the interplanetary magnetic field—itself an extension of the heliomagnetic field—controls the behavior of the magnetosphere. Diffusion allows the interplanetary magnetic fieldand 
geomagnetic field to connect, opening the interior of the magnetosphere to interplanetary space. Figure 6(a) depicts magnetic connection on the magnetosphere’s day side (for additional discussion of magnetic 
connection, see Physics Today, Physics Today 0031-9228 54 10 2001 16, October 2001, page 16); on the night side, an opposite process occurs with disconnection of interplanetary and geomagnetic field lines 
in the magnetotail. With an open magnetosphere, the dragging of field lines across Earth’s polar cap by the solar wind establishes a solar-wind dynamo. That induces convection-like motion of plasma in 
the magnetosphere and polar ionosphere, and it can energize the ring current.,
 Occasionally, abrupt ejections or high-speed streams of plasmafrom the Sun push the magnetosphere into a highly dynamic, time-dependent state called a magnetic storm. That colorful expression was coined 
by von Humboldt in 1808 to describe occasional periods during which ground-based measurements show large, rapid, and irregular variation of the geomagnetic field. A magnetic storm can last from several 
hours to several days. Some also exhibit shorter-duration substorms. The cause and effect of substorms is controversial, but, generally speaking, substorms result from a temporary buildup of energy in 
the magnetotail that is released explosively through a sudden collapse of part of the tail current and diversion of current along magnetic-field lines. As a result, the magnetospheric electric circuit 
closes through the ionosphere, a detour that can give rise to beautiful auroral displays at high latitudes.,
 One of the largest magnetic storms on record occurred just before Halloween 2003. Figure 6(b) shows horizontal-intensity magnetograms of that storm, which was initiated by a coronal mass ejection associated 
with a large sunspot group. Observatory magnetograms recorded a sudden impulsive change during the distinctive initial phase (I) that resulted from solar-windcompression of the magnetopause and magnetic 
connection. The following main phase (M) was distinguished by a general decrease in H at low magnetic latitudes, the signature of an increasing equatorial ring current: The westward ring current generates 
a southward magnetic field in its interior, the Earth side. Since the generated field points opposite to Earth’s prevailing northward dipole field, it decreases H. Indeed, a longitudinal average of the 
disturbance in H from low-latitude observatories is proportional to the average increase in strength of the ring current. The recovery phase (R) of the storm corresponds to ring-current diminution and 
a return of low-latitude H to prestorm levels. The Halloween stormis somewhat unusual in that it exhibited two main phases, each followed by a recovery period.,
 A detailed comparison of low- and high-latitude magnetograms reveals substorm occurrences during the Halloween storm. For example, figure 6(b) displays data from two comparable longitude pairs of observatories 
that show intermittent periods of anticorrelation. During those times partial collapse of the ring or tail current gives an increase in H at low latitudes, while closure of the current system along field 
lines and through the ionospheregives a simultaneous decrease in H at high latitudes. Thus magnetic-observatory data can be used to monitor the electric circuit of the coupled magnetospheric–ionospheric 
system, notwithstanding that every magnetic storm has its own unique and often complex character.,
 The Sun’s dynamo is oscillatory. As a result, the Sun’s magnetic polarity reverses once every 11 years or so and sunspot number and solar irradiance wax and wane (see reference 7 and the article by Judith 
Lean, Physics Today, Physics Today 0031-9228 58 6 2005 32, June 2005, page 32 ). Figure 7 shows that magnetic activity, as measured by the monthly standard deviation in H, is modulated in phase with the 
solar cycle. The spikes in magnetic standard deviation during, for example, the years 1921, 1941, and 1989 correspond to large magnetic storms. The discovery that magnetic storms are more likely to occur 
during periods of sunspot maxima and less likely to occur with sunspot minima was one of the most important in the history of space physics. It was made in 1852 by the astronomer and British major general 
Edward Sabine, who carefully analyzed a long time series of data collected by various magnetic observatories including one located, at the time, in Toronto. In his words, the discovery gave to geomagnetism 
a “much higher position in the scale of distinct natural forces than was previously assigned to it.”,
 Understanding magnetic storms is important for risk mitigation. Storm-induced currents in the crust can be a nuisance for the electric power industry, since they can find their way into power lines and 
transformers through ground connections. 12 The most prominent example of that particular hazard occurred in March 1989, when a large magnetic storm led to the collapse of the electrical power grid serving 
the entire Canadian province of Quebec. Magnetic storms interfere with magnetic crustal surveys undertaken for mapping and mineral exploration, and they interfere with in situ magnetic orientation systems 
used for directional drilling. During magnetic storms, long-distance radio communication can be difficult, and the accuracy of global positioning systems can be reduced. In space, satellite electronics 
can be damaged and satellite orbital drag enhanced. Astronauts and high-altitude pilots might be subjected to increased radiation.,
 Since magnetic storms were first identified through ground-based magnetic measurement, it is perhaps not surprising that standard measures of magnetic-storm size are defined using magnetic-observatory 
data. Real-time observatory data are used for low-cost monitoring or “nowcasting” of space weather. And historical observatory data enable statistical studies of how storms are distributed in time and 
how big they can be. Because of the potential risk to the activities and infrastructure of our modern, technology-based society, the US federal government supports the interagency National Space Weather 
Program. Similar programs also exist in Japan and Europe.,
 The wide-ranging utility of magnetic-observatory data testifies to the importance of programs dedicated to accurate and long-term geophysical measurement. And the data themselves are a lasting legacy 
of the many hard-working individuals who have supported observatory operations for almost 170 years.,

 Magnetic declination (sometimes called magnetic variation) is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Declination is positive when this angle is east of true north and negative when it is west. 
Magnetic declination changes over time, and with location. Declination value is needed to determine true north, because compasses point toward magnetic north.,
 You can compute the true bearing from a magnetic bearing by adding the magnetic declination to the magnetic bearing. This works as long as you follow the convention that degrees west are negative (i.e. 
a magnetic declination of 10-degrees west is -10 and bearing of 45-degrees west is -45). Some example case illustrations are provided for an east magnetic declination and a west magnetic declination.,

 The Earth's magnetic field is slowly changing on time scales that range from years to millennia. Such changes are referred to as secular variation. Secular variation was first recognized in 1634 when 
Gellibrand compared magnetic declination observations he had made at London with earlier observations. The observations of declination made at London over the years constitute one of the best records of 
secular variation. ,
 The figure shows that declination has changed from approximately 10° E in the late 16th century to 25° W in the early 19th century before returning to a current value of about 3° W.,
 All elements of the magnetic field change with time - not just the declination. For example, the total intensity at Toronto has decreased 14%, from approximately 64,000 nT to 55,000 nT, during the last 
160 years.,
 These three figures illustrate two important points about secular variation: it is not constant in time and it varies from place to place. The average annual change of the vertical component (excluding 
sign) is about 45 nT per year. However the chart shows areas of intense secular variation called isoporic foci where the SV can be a factor of four larger than this. In the most intense isoporic focus 
the SV exceeds 170 nT (decreasing).,
 A comparison of the dipole part of the magnetic field calculated from spherical harmonic models produced for different years shows that the strength of the dipole has been decreasing since the early nineteenth 
century. Archeomagnetic evidence shows that this decrease has, in fact, been going on for the last two thousand years, and that the strength of the dipole now is only about half of what it was two millenia 
ago. The dipole strength is currently decreasing at a rate of about 6.3% per century, and were it to continue to decrease at that rate, the strength would reach zero in approximately 1600 years. On the 
other hand, it might start to increase again sometime during the next few decades.,
 In the early eighteenth century Edmund Halley noticed that the agonic line, the line of zero declination on a declination chart, was slowly moving westward. Since then it has been well established that 
certain features of the secular variation, such as isoporic foci, tend to drift westward with an average velocity of about 0.2° per year. However, westward drift is not equal everywhere. It is stronger 
in the Atlantic hemisphere than in the Pacific hemisphere. It was also less than average in North America over the past 150 years.,
 There are certain features of the geomagnetic field that do not drift; they appear to grow and decay in roughly the same place. A persistent feature of the geomagnetic field over Canada has been a large 
maximum in total intensity centred approximately over northern Manitoba. Total force observations made in the first half of the 18th century show that it was present at that time. There is also evidence 
that it may actually be a semi-permanent feature of the magnetic field with a lifetime of millions of years. However, since the mid-nineteenth century, the maximum has been decaying rapidly while remaining 
roughly stationary. The figure shows a decrease of over 4000 nT during the 20th century.,
 Secular variation, like the magnetic field itself, originates in the outer core of the Earth, and is an integral part of the process by which the field is generated. Several different mechanisms are probably 
involved, resulting in changes on different time scales, which can mostly be described in terms of the three processes described earlier. However, at the short end of the secular variation time scale is 
one of the most interesting features of secular variation - the geomagnetic jerk. Jerks were first discovered by a group of French researchers (Courtillot et al., 1978), who noticed that at many magnetic 
observatories the trend in secular variation before 1969 differed markedly from the trend after 1969. This change in trend was most noticeable in the east component of the magnetic field at European observatories, 
but it was evident at almost all the world's observatories, and it happened at roughly the same time everywhere.,
 Since the discovery of the 1969 jerk , scientists have found five additional jerks of global extent during the twentieth century: in 1901,1913,1925,1978 and 1992. The last two of these, as well as the 
1969 jerk, can be seen in the figure, which shows the annual change in declination at Meanook Magnetic Observatory, north of Edmonton.,
 Electromagnetic variations have been observed after earthquakes, but despite decades of work, there is no convincing evidence of electromagnetic precursors to earthquakes. It is worth acknowledging that 
geophysicists would actually love to demonstrate the reality of such precursors, especially if they could be used for reliably predicting earthquakes! Learn more: USGS Geomagnetism Program,
 Yes. There is evidence that some animals, like sea turtles and salmon, have the ability to sense the Earth's magnetic field (although probably not consciously) and to use this sense for navigation.,
 Magnetic poles are commonly understood as positions on Earth's surface where the geomagnetic field is vertical (i.e., perpendicular) to the ellipsoid. These north and south positions, called dip poles, 
do not need to be (and are not currently) antipodal. In principle, the dip poles can be found by conducting a magnetic survey to determine where the field is vertical. In practice, the geomagnetic field 
is vertical on oval-shaped loci traced on a daily basis, with considerable variation from one day to the next. Other definitions of geomagnetic poles depend on the way the poles are computed from a geomagnetic 
model.,
 It has been long understood that dip poles migrate over time. In 1831, James Clark Ross located the north dip pole position in northern Canada. Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) tracked the North Magnetic 
Pole, which is slowly drifting across the Canadian Arctic, by periodically carrying out magnetic surveys to reestablish the Pole's location from 1948 to 1994. An international collaboration, led by a French 
fundraising association, Poly-Arctique, and involving NRCan, Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris and Bureau de Recherche Geologique et Miniere, added two locations of the North Magnetic Pole in 2001 
and 2007. The most recent survey determined that the Pole is moving approximately north-northwest at 55km per year.,
 Geomagnetic field models can also define geomagnetic poles. The geomagnetic poles, or geocentric dipole, can be computed from the first three Gauss coefficients from a main field model, such as the World 
Magnetic Model (WMM) or International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF). The WMM representation of the field includes a magnetic dipole at the center of Earth. This dipole defines an axis that intersects 
Earth's surface at two antipodal points called geomagnetic poles. Based on the WMM2020 coefficients for 2020.0, the Geomagnetic North Pole is at 72.68°W longitude and 80.37°N latitude, and the Geomagnetic 
South Pole is at 107.32°E longitude and 80.37°S latitude. The axis of the dipole is currently inclined at 9.41° to Earth's rotation axis. The same dipole is the basis for the simple geomagnetic coordinate 
system of geomagnetic latitude and longitude. ,
 Scientists, map makers, and polar explorers have an interest in the locations of the dip and geomagnetic poles. Although geomagnetic pole positions cannot be observed, they are arguably of greater significance 
than the dip poles because the auroral ovals (approximate 5° latitude bands where the spectacular aurora is likely visible) are closely centered on the geomagnetic poles. They are usually displaced slightly 
to the night-side of the geomagnetic poles and greatly vary in size: bands of greatest activity occur between 15° and 25° from the geomagnetic poles.,
 GM POLE is a program that can compute the locations of the geomagnetic poles from January 1900–December 2015 using a linear interpolation of the dipole Gauss coefficients from the geomagnetic reference 
field models (see file ALL-IGRF.TAB below). This program uses a computational method devised by Fraser-Smith (1987) and originally coded by W.H. Campbell. New version coded by Adam Woods. ,
 The magnetic poles or dip poles are computed from all the Gauss coefficients using an iterative method. Magnetic poles derived in this fashion are geographically closer to the experimentally observed 
poles. Based on the current WMM, the 2020 location of the North Magnetic Pole is 86.50°N and 164.04°E and the South Magnetic Pole is 64.07°S and 135.88°E.,
 The World Magnetic Model (WMM) is the standard model for navigation, attitude, and heading referencing systems using the geomagnetic field. Additional WMM uses include civilian applications, including 
navigation and heading systems.,
 The model is a joint product of the United States’ National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the United Kingdom’s Defence Geographic Centre (DGC). NCEI and the British Geological Survey (BGS) 
jointly developed the WMM. The U.S. Department of Defense, the U.K. Ministry of Defence, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) use the WMM.,

 The model, associated software, and documentation are distributed by NCEI on behalf of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). The model is produced at 5-year intervals, with the current model 
expiring on December 31, 2024.,
 Download links first take you to a voluntary survey page. We request that you complete the survey to receive up to date information about WMM via email. Your feedback will strengthen the WMM program.,

 NCEI provides access to the DoD software and current WMM and WMM online calculator. The software computes the main components of the geomagnetic field and their annual changes. The programs are designed 
to be used in demand mode. The software is available as C source code. The model file, WMM.COF (format specification), is available in the same directory as the software.  Note:The altitude is referenced 
to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) ellipsoid. The WMM software library provides functions to convert height above mean sea level (AMSL) to height above WGS 84. This option is enabled by default.,

 Annual change, also known as Secular Variation (SV) in each of these magnetic components, is also displayed. The annual change is computed by subtracting the main field values for the desired input date 
from main field values one year later. The output units are displayed using the abbreviations nT (nanoTesla), deg (degrees) and min (minutes) per year. The new WMM2020 software also outputs uncertainty 
for each component. The error is one standard deviation difference between a hypothetical measurement and model output. The uncertainty values have the same units as their corresponding components.,

 Note: Because WMM is a \predictive only\ model, we do not make the older models (WMM.COF files) widely available. We recommend using the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) models for years 
prior to 2015. IGRF is updated retrospectively to provide the best available estimate of the geomagnetic field back to 1900.,
 The modular C WMM software reads the coefficient file, WMM.COF, and computes the geomagnetic field at the user-specified location. The download file is always the latest version. This software for the 
WMM is developed as a C sub-library that can be incorporated into other applications and software. We use a modular programming approach to facilitate reuse in other applications. We also provide wrapper 
programs to produce single point, time series, and grid values of the magnetic field. The core numerical functions are optimized for speed and efficiency.,
 The geoid implementation of the WMM software references the altitude of the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) ellipsoid. This is generally called height above ellipsoid (HAE). However, WMM users may 
be more familiar with the height above mean sea level (AMSL). The difference between AMSL and HAE varies with location and the total variation is less than 200 meters. The software allows users to enter 
their altitude above the mean sea level rather than their height above ellipsoid. Conversion between heights referenced to MSL and WGS84 ellipsoid was implemented using the EGM96 geoid.,
 The correction results in a difference of magnetic field strength of about 1-3 nT. The largest differences in magnetic field strength coincide with the largest deviations of the geoid from the WGS-84 
ellipsoid. However, the effect of geoid height correction is negligible in the magnetic declination. The EGM-96 geoid height file will also be supplied with the WMM package for this purpose. This option 
is enabled by default.,
 The software accurately computes the associated Legendre functions up to degree 2,800, making it adaptable for high-degree geomagnetic models. Details of the WMMWorld Magnetic Model derivation are described 
in The US/UK World Magnetic Model for 2020-2025: Technical Report.,
 This calculator provides annual change, also known as secular variation (SV), for each of these magnetic components. Annual change is computed by subtracting the main field values for the desired input 
date from main field values one year later. The output units are displayed using the abbreviations nT (nanoTesla), deg (degrees) and min (minutes) per year.,
 WMM2020 software also provides uncertainty and estimated error for each component. The error is one standard deviation difference between a hypothetical measurement and model output. The uncertainty values 
have the same units as their corresponding components.,

 Contour maps were created for each of the seven magnetic elements (D, I, H, X, Y, Z, and F) and for their secular variation (rate of change). These maps are available for download in pdf format by clicking 
on the browse images below or you can download a zip file containing all of the map pdfs with or without the blackout zones. Maps are available in Adobe PDF and Esri Shapefile format.,
 The WMM consists of a degree and order 12 spherical-harmonic main (i.e., core-generated) field model of 168 spherical-harmonic Gauss coefficients and degree and order 12 spherical-harmonic Secular Variation 
(SV) (core-generated, slow temporal variation) field model. WMM2020 supersedes WMM2015 and WMM2015v2 and should replace these models in navigation systems. Also included with the model is computer software 
(available in C) for computing the magnetic field components X, Y, Z, F, D, I, and H in geodetic coordinates and their temporal variations. The spherical-harmonic expansions used to compute the magnetic 
field components are the same as the ones described in The US/UK World Magnetic Model for 2015–2020: Technical Report.,
 Earth's magnetic field, as measured by a magnetic sensor on or above Earth's surface, is actually the sum of magnetic fields generated by a variety of sources. These fields are superimposed on each other 
and through inductive processes interact with each other. The most important are these geomagnetic fields:,
 The observed magnetic field is a sum of contributions of the main field (varying in both time and space), the crustal field (varies spatially, but considered constant in time for the time-scales of the 
WMM), and the disturbance fields (varying in space and rapidly in time). Earth's main magnetic field dominates, accounting for over 95% of the field strength at Earth’s surface. Secular variation is the 
slow change in time of the main magnetic field. The WMM represents only the main geomagnetic field.,
 To create an accurate magnetic field model, it is necessary to have vector component measurements with good global coverage and low noise levels. The European Space Agency's SWARM satellite mission is 
presently the most suitable magnetic observing system. Also available are ground observatory hourly mean data, although with poorer spatial coverage. The observatory data can provide valuable constraints 
on the time variations of the geomagnetic field.,
 Compasses have been used for several thousand years to determine direction. They point in the direction of magnetic force at the user's location, and the direction it points is, more often than not, in 
a different direction than geographic north (toward the North Pole). A more precise direction is achieved by knowing the angle between them (magnetic declination). However, declination changes with location 
and time, and a geomagnetic model is often used to correct for it. Since the changes in geomagnetic fields are difficult to predict, timely model updates (every five years for the WMM) are required for 
navigational accuracy. The WMM satisfies all these criteria and is therefore widely used in navigation. Examples include, but are not limited to, ships, aircraft, and submarines. Aircraft and satellites 
commonly use magnetometer based attitude (roll and pitch) control.,
 Why do we need magnetic navigation when the Global Position System (GPS) is readily available? GPS provides precise point location but only measures travel direction when in constant motion. A GPS receiver 
must collect several sets of latitude and longitude pairs to obtain direction. In addition, GPS signals may become blocked due to obstructions, adverse terrestrial and space weather, ionospheric conditions, 
or being underwater or underground. Hence, compasses complement GPS receivers to attain precise and immediate navigational headings for air, ground, and water-based systems. Electronic compasses and the 
WMM commonly co-exist in GPS receivers.,
 Antennas (e.g. satellite dish television) and solar panels often need to be precisely oriented for maximum performance. The WMM's declination information for specific locations is often employed by companies 
to orient their products correctly.,
 While the WMM is traditionally used for navigation, it is now acquiring new utilities in consumer electronic devices with built-in digital compasses. Many of the new generations of smartphones and digital 
cameras take advantage of the WMM to estimate bearing. The availability of low-cost, small, and energy efficient electronic compasses allow for magnetic direction in portable electronics to be commonplace. 
NOAA is providing support to application development engineers to port WMM to their devices. For example, WMM comes pre-installed in Android and iOS devices, thereby bringing its use to more than a billion 
devices around the world. NOAA/NCEI has developed an application called CrowdMag that allows users to collect their own magnetic field data using the magnetometers in their phone. This app sends data anonymously 
back to NOAA so it can be used to help validate and expand future magnetic models.,
 Oil and mineral exploration companies use airborne and marine magnetic fields to detect magnetic signals from Earth's crust. These small amplitude signals (typically 100s of nT), must be separated from 
the large main magnetic field (typically 20,000 to 60,000 nT). Companies use geomagnetic models to extract these small magnetic signals from the survey records. A new application uses geomagnetic models 
for directional drilling. Oil wells are often drilled horizontally from a conveniently located platform. An electronic compass located behind the drill head (bit) provides the engineers with accurate orientation 
of the bit.,
 The December 2021 State of the Geomagnetic Field report is now available. This report provides an assessment of the performance of the WMM2020 two years after its release, and describes noteworthy changes 
in the Earth's main magnetic field, including magnetic pole drifts and the deepening of the South Atlantic Anomaly.,
 Changes of the fluid flow in Earth's outer core lead to unpredictable changes in Earth's magnetic field. Fortunately, the system has large inertia, so that these changes take place over time scales of 
many years. By surveying the field for a few years, one can precisely map the present field and its rate of change and then linearly extrapolate it out into the future. Provided that suitable satellite 
magnetic observations are available, the prediction of the WMM is highly accurate on its release date and then subsequently deteriorates towards the end of the five-year epoch, when it has to be updated 
with revised values of the model coefficients.,
 It is important to recognize that the WMM and the charts produced from this model characterize only the long-wavelength portion of Earth's internal magnetic field, which is primarily generated in Earth's 
fluid outer core. The portions of the geomagnetic field generated by Earth's crust and upper mantle, and by the ionosphere and magnetosphere, are largely unrepresented in the WMM. Consequently, a magnetic 
sensor such as a compass or magnetometer may observe spatial and temporal magnetic anomalies when referenced to the WMM. In particular, certain local, regional, and temporal magnetic declination anomalies 
can exceed 10 degrees. Anomalies of this magnitude are not common but they do exist. Declination anomalies of the order of 3 or 4 degrees are not uncommon but are usually of small spatial extent. See the 
Enhanced Magnetic Model (EMM) for a model which includes crustal fields down to 50km wavelength.,
 Based on the WMM military specification, we define “Blackout Zones” (BoZ) around the north and south magnetic poles where compass accuracy is highly degraded. The BoZ are defined as regions around the 
north and south magnetic poles where the horizontal intensity of Earth’s magnetic field (H) is less than 2000 nT. In BoZs, WMM declination values are inaccurate and compasses are unreliable.,
 We additionally define a “Caution Zone” (2000 nT <= H < 6000 nT) around the BoZ, where caution must be exercised while using a compass. Compass accuracy may be degraded in this region. The blackout (unreliable) 
and caution zones are displayed in figures 2 and 3. The WMM online/offline software displays warnings when the user location is within these zones.,
 The WMM2020 software and online calculator include an error model providing uncertainty estimates for every geomagnetic element (X, Y, Z, H, F, I and D) and every location at Earth's surface. This model 
is built upon the results of the error analysis (see the WMM2020 technical report, to be published in February 2020), while taking into account the geometrical relationships between the various components. 
It includes both the commission error (due to inaccuracies in model coefficients) and the omission error (due to missing contributions to the total geomagnetic field such as crustal and external fields). 
The error values (Table 1) may be interpreted as one standard deviation difference between a hypothetical measurement and the calculator result for a location.,
 A global map of the magnetic declination error is provided in Fig. 3. As can be seen on this map, the error is lower at mid- to low-latitudes, while it is larger near the magnetic poles and in an area 
close to South Africa where the horizontal field is very low. ,
 Based on the WMM2020 coefficients for 2020.0 the geomagnetic north pole is at 72.68°W longitude and 80.65°N latitude, and the geomagnetic south pole is at 107.32°E longitude and 80.65°S latitude. The 
axis of the dipole is currently inclined at 9.41° to Earth's rotation axis. The WMM can also be used to calculate dipole positions. These model dip poles are computed from all the Gauss coefficients using 
an iterative method. In 2020.0 the north dip pole computed from WMM2020 is located at longitude 164.04°E and latitude 86.50°N and the south dipole at longitude 135.88°E and latitude 64.07°S.,
 Every year, the performance of the WMM is assessed by comparing it to a more recent main geomagnetic field model, and by comparing its secular variation with the actual secular variation observed at ground-based 
observatories and satellite-based geomagnetic virtual observatories (GVOs). The evolution of the WMM Blackout Zones and the validity of the WMM error model are also reviewed as part of this assessment. 
For more information, see the latest State of the Geomagnetic Field report.,
 The World Magnetic Model coefficient file is named “WMM.COF”. Numerical values of the Gauss coefficients (g_nm, h_nm, g_dot_nm, h_dot_nm) at the base epoch; their corresponding predictive annual changes 
for the next five years; and their associated degrees and orders are provided in this file. For more details about the WMM Gauss coefficients, see section 1.2 of the WMM Technical report.,
 WMM coefficients are written to this file in a specific format. If implemented correctly, then the WMM.COF file format is designed to update to a new WMM by replacing the old “WMM.COF” file with the new 
“WMM.COF” file, without needing to make any changes to the software. The “WMM.COF” file is an ASCII file with one header line, 90 lines of coefficients data and two terminating lines. Each line has 48 
characters, ending with a carriage return and a linefeed (\\\r).,
 WMM is valid for five years from the \Model Epoch\ parameter given in decimal years. The \Date of release\ of the model has no significance in magnetic field calculation and is U.S. style, MM/DD/YYYY.,

 Dynamic events on the Sun’s surface can affect the Earth and technological systems of importance to modern society. The charged particles of the solar wind interact with the geomagnetic field of the Earth’s 
surrounding space environment. Usually, this interaction is relatively subdued, but every once in a while the Sun emits a burst of solar wind that causes the temporary disturbance in the Earth’s magnetic 
field – a magnetic storm.,
 Magnetic storms can wreak havoc on the electric power grids and communication lines. In September of 1859, a magnetic superstorm caused widespread interference to telegraph systems, even sparking fires 
at some telegraph stations. In March of 1989, an intense magnetic storm caused a black-out across Québec; in November of 2001 another storm caused the failure of electrical power transmission in New Zealand; 
and yet another in October of 2003, called the Halloween storm, brought significant interference to the power-grid system in Sweden. Several studies, including one issued by the National Academy of Sciences, 
suggest that the future occurrence of a magnetic superstorm could cause widespread blackouts that would carry a significant economic cost.,
 A hazard is the probability that a dangerous natural phenomenon will occur in a given window of time, with a certain size, and in a given location. So, for example, a 100-year geoelectric hazard is the 
amplitude of the geoelectric field that is only attained or exceeded at a given location once per century on average. The 100-year geoelectric hazard level is the standard used by electric utility companies 
for investigating the resilience of their systems to the effects of rare, but very intense magnetic storms. Maps of 100-year geoelectric hazards assist utility company engineers as they examine which parts 
of distributed power-grid networks are more exposed, or, conversely, less exposed, to the deleterious effects of magnetic storms.,
 The geoelectric hazard at any particular location depends on both the regional intensity of geomagnetic activity and on the electrical conductivity of the surrounding rock and deeper Earth material. To 
create a geoelectric hazard map, research scientists of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Geomagnetism Program analyze historical records of magnetic storms acquired at long-running magnetic observatories, 
including those operated by the USGS across the continental United States. This analysis is then combined with magnetotelluric measurements of the relationship between geomagnetic activity and the induced 
geoelectric field, such as those that have been made at various geographic sites across the continental United States as part of the National Science Foundation’s EarthScope project.,
 Recently, Geomagnetism Program scientists have concentrated on regional mapping of geoelectric hazards across the Pacific Northwest and the Eastern United States. This work shows that geoelectric hazards 
maps are closely correlated with geologic structures. During a magnetic storm, conducting rock allow currents to flow in the Earth in response to a weak geoelectric field. These currents flow relatively 
easily through rock that is relatively electrically conductive, and less easily through rock that is relatively resistive. All of this means that, during a magnetic storm, electric currents, driven by 
geoelectric fields in the Earth, will tend to be diverted through electric power grids if they are situated atop the electrically resistive rock.,
 By integrating the geoelectric field induced during a magnetic storm along a power-grid line, one can estimate the voltage on the line. During an intense magnetic storm, hundreds, and even thousands, 
of volts can be generated on long power lines. These voltages are not the carefully controlled alternating voltages provided by generating stations, and, indeed, geomagnetically induced voltages can drive 
uncontrolled currents on power grids that are of sufficient strength to damage transformers. If many transformers are damaged, as might happen during a magnetic superstorm, the result could be prolonged 
loss of electric power across a broad region of the United States.,
 An important ongoing project of the USGS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is the real-time mapping of geoelectric fields across the continental United States. To accomplish this, 
real-time maps of the geomagnetic field, created using data from magnetic observatories, are combined with magnetotelluric survey measurements to estimate the time-varying geoelectric field. These geoelectric 
field maps will assist utility companies with their real-time operations – enabling the assessment of geoelectric hazards as they evolve over the course of a magnetic storm and helping power-grid managers 
to make decisions that may minimize the impact to their systems.,

 The International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) is a standard mathematical description of the Earth's main magnetic field. It is used widely in studies of the Earth's deep interior, crust, ionosphere, 
and magnetosphere. While this web page is hosted at NOAA/NCEI, the model itself is developed and maintained by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA).,
 The coefficients for the 13th generation of IGRF model were finalized by an IAGA task force in December 2019. The IGRF is the product of a collaborative effort between magnetic field modelers and the 
institutes involved in collecting and disseminating magnetic field data collected from satellites, observatories, and surveys around the world. Please review the Model Health Warning before using the IGRF.,

 The software code is in the public domain and not licensed or under copyright. The information and software may be used freely by the public. As required by 17 U.S.C. 403, third parties producing copyrighted 
works consisting predominantly of the material produced by U.S. government agencies must provide notice with such work(s) identifying the U.S. Government material incorporated and stating that such material 
is not subject to copyright protection.,
 Older versions of the IGRF may be required in special cases. For example, if a magnetic survey was conducted in 1983, the appropriate predictive IGRF-3 (available at that time) would have been subtracted 
to make an anomaly map. If the original data are no longer available to update the map, add the IGRF-3 to the anomaly map and then subtract IGRF-13 which includes the required definitive magnetic reference 
field (DGRF) model for 1980–1985.,
 The IGRF is a series of mathematical models of the Earth's main field and its annual rate of change (secular variation). In source-free regions at the Earth's surface and above, the main field, with sources 
internal to the Earth, is the negative gradient of a scalar potential V which can be represented by a truncated series expansion:,
 Here, a = 6371.2 km and the degree of truncation is N = 13. The 13th Generation IGRF coefficients were computed from candidate sets of coefficients produced by the participating members of IAGA Working 
Group V-MOD. Their institutes and the many organizations involved in operating magnetic survey satellites, observatories, magnetic survey programs and World Data Centers are to be thanked for their continuing 
support of the IGRF project.,
 There are numerous indices of magnetic activity. The International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) officially recognizes magnetic indices aa, Am, Kp, Dst, and AE. More information about 
the IAGA indices is available from the International Services for Geomagnetic Indices (ISGI).,
 A simple global index of magnetic activity is produced in France from the K indices of two nearly antipodal magnetic observatories in England and Australia. This index aa, is the 3-hourly equivalent amplitude 
antipodal index. Daily average AA may be derived similarly to Ap. An historical advantage to using aa rather than ap is that these indices have been extended back in time through scaling of magnetic activity 
from magnetograms of earlier observations. The aa indices are derived from 1868 to the present. An AA* index has been derived that is the counterpart of Ap* but is available for a longer span of years. 
However, the AA* is derived from indices from only two magnetic observatories whereas Ap* incorporates indices from more observatories.,
 Because of the difference in units of presentation, the values of AA* and Ap* are not the same so that different major magnetic storm onset and end threshold values are used for the two series. However 
their comparison for the years of overlapping coverage show that relative frequency of occurrence of major storms per year are similar. Another reason for differences is that an index derived from magnetic 
perturbation values at only two observatories easily experiences larger extreme values if either input site is well situated to the overhead ionospheric and.or field aligned current systems producing the 
magnetic storm effects. Although not documented here, it is interesting to note that the overall level of magnetic disturbance from year to year has increased substantially from a low around 1900 Also, 
the level of mean yearly aa is now much higher so that a year of minimum magnetic disturbances now is typically more disturbed than years at maximum disturbance levels before 1900.,
 The Auroral Electrojet Index, AE, is designed to provide a global, quantitative measure of auroral zone magnetic activity produced by enhanced Ionospheric currents flowing below and within the auroral 
oval. Ideally, It is the total range of deviation at an instant of time from quiet day values of the horizontal magnetic field (h) around the auroral oval. Defined and developed by Davis and Sugiura [1966], 
AE has been usefully employed both qualitatively and quantitatively as a correlative index in studies of substorm morphology, the behavior of communication satellites, radio propagation, radio scintillation, 
and the coupling between the interplanetary magnetic field and the earth's magnetosphere. For these varied uses, AE possesses advantages over other geomagnetic indices or at least shares their advantageous 
properties:,
 These indices were and are derived in response to indications of need as voiced by the scientific user community in journal articles, at meetings in resolutions of national and international groups, and 
in personal communications.,
 Ap* is defined as the earliest occurring maximum 24-hour value obtained by computing an 8-point running average of successive 3-hour ap indices during a geomagnetic storm event without regard to the starting 
and ending times of the UT-day. It is uniquely associated with the storm event. Over many years, values of Ap* provide a maximum disturbance measure useful to identify major geomagnetic storms chronologically 
(by date and start time) and by amplitude from largest to the smallest. The earliest possible values are for 1932, because that is the first year for which the standard Kp and ap indices were produced. 
As NGDC staff or others have time to update Ap*, tables of values are available from 1932 to recent times. ,
 DST (Disturbance Storm Time) equivalent equatorial magnetic disturbance indices are derived from hourly scaling's of low-latitude horizontal magnetic variation. They show the effect of the globally symmetrical 
westward flowing high altitude equatorial ring current, which causes the \main phase\ depression worldwide in the H-component field during large magnetic storms. This diskette contains the hourly indices 
for the period 1 Jan 1957 through 30 Sep 1992, as derived by M. Sugiura and T. Kamei, WDC-C2 for Geomagnetism, Faculty of Science, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606, Japan.,
 Hourly H-component magnetic variations are analyzed to remove annual secular change trends from records of a worldwide array of low-latitude observatories. A cosine factor of the site latitude transforms 
residual variations to their equatorial equivalents and harmonic analysis isolates the term used as the DST index. Sugiura described DST derivation in ANNALS OF THE IGY.,
 Partial and symmetric magnetospheric ring currents, magnetopause, neutral sheet and tail currents generate a magnetic disturbance field which is monitored by the global network of magnetic observatories. 
The dominant axi-symmetric part of this disturbance field is estimated from the recordings at four low-latitude observatories and is distributed by the World Data Centers as the Dst index.,
 Further separating the disturbance magnetic field into external and induced contributions provides the Est index for the external source field and the Ist index for the internal induced field. (Ref: Maus, 
Stefan; Weidelt, Peter; Separating the magnetospheric disturbance magnetic field into external and transient internal contributions using a 1D conductivity model of the Earth; Geophys. Res. Lett., Vol. 
31, No. 12, L12614),
 The physical motivation for this separation is that the time varying magnetospheric fields induce electric currents in the Earth which in turn give rise to a secondary internal field whose strength is 
roughly one third of the external field. Hence, the disturbance field observed at the Earth's surface is the sum of the external source field and its induced counterpart. If the Earth were an ideal conductor 
then the two fields would be exactly in phase because currents would be induced in such a way as to prevent any external field from entering into the conductor.,
 Furthermore, for an ideal conductor the strength of the induced field would be such that its radial component would cancel the radial component of the inducing field everywhere on its surface. For the 
real Earth, however, the phase lag and amplitude relation between the induced internal and inducing external field depends on the frequency content of the external source field.,
 Daily regular magnetic field variation arise from current systems caused by regular solar radiation changes. Other irregular current systems produce magnetic field changes caused by the interaction of 
the solar wind with the magnetosphere, by the magnetosphere itself, by the interactions between the magnetosphere and ionosphere, and by the ionosphere itself.,
 The K-index is quasi-logarithmic local index of the 3-hourly range in magnetic activity relative to an assumed quiet-day curve for a single geomagnetic observatory site. First introduced by J. Bartels 
in 1938, it consists of a single-digit 0 thru 9 for each 3-hour interval of the universal time day (UT).,
 The planetary 3-hour-range index Kp is the mean standardized K-index from 13 geomagnetic observatories between 44 degrees and 60 degrees northern or southern geomagnetic latitude. The scale is O to 9 
expressed in thirds of a unit, e.g. 5- is 4 2/3, 5 is 5 and 5+ is 5 1/3. This planetary index is designed to measure solar particle radiation by its magnetic effects. The 3-hourly ap (equivalent range) 
index is derived from the Kp index as follows:,
 Other planetary indices include the Ap* and AA*. The Ap* index is defined as the earliest occurring maximum 24-hour value obtained by computing an 8-point running average of successive 3-hour ap indices 
during a geomagnetic storm event and is uniquely associated with the storm event. The AA* index is similar to the Ap* index, but has a longer history and is based on reports from only two stations.,
 The F10.7 Index has proven very valuable in specifying and forecasting space weather.   Because it is a long record, it provides climatology of solar activity over six solar cycles.  Because it comes 
from the chromosphere and corona of the sun, it tracks other important emissions that form in the same regions of the solar atmosphere.   The Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) emissions that impact the ionosphere 
and modify the upper atmosphere track well with the F10.7 index.  Many Ultra-Violet emissions that affect the stratosphere and ozone also correlate with the F10.7 index.  And because this measurement can 
be made reliably and accurately from the ground in all weather conditions, it is a very robust data set with few gaps or calibration issues.,
 Satellite communication refers to any communication link that involves the use of an artificial satellite in its propagation path. Satellite communications play a vital role in modern life. There are 
over 2000 artificial satellites in use. They can be found in geostationary, Molniya, elliptical, and low Earth orbits and are used for traditional point-to-point communications, mobile applications, and 
the distribution of TV and radio programs. For a brief history of satellite communications see: https://www.britannica.com/technology/satellite-communication​. For details on communication satellite orbits 
and satellite communication applications see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite.,
 Satellite communications tend to use high frequency signals: Ultra High Frequency (UHF), 300 MHz - 3 GHz and Super High Frequency (SHF), 3 - 30 GHz. Radio signals propagating to and from a satellite in 
orbit are affected by the environmental conditions along the propagation path. In a vacuum, radio signals propagate at the speed of light, but in the presence of plasma in the ionosphere, the signals are 
affected by group delay and phase advance and attenuation due to absorption and scintillation. The environment's effect on the signal is frequency dependent and to a first approximation is proportional 
to the amount of structure in the plasma present along the propagation path.,
 Due to ionospheric variability (Space Weather), the effects on propagating signals are highly variable. Up to some level, the effects of Space Weather on propagation can be mitigated through engineering 
design solutions, but space weather can lead to a total loss of communication due to attenuation and/or severe scintillation when the broadcast signals cross the ionosphere. In trans-ionosphere propagation, 
scintillation refers to the rapid variation of the amplitude and phase of a received signal. Scintillation is produced by structure in the ionosphere. The severity of scintillation depends on the frequency 
of the used signal and the spatial structure of plasma density and plasma drifts along the propagation path. Specifically, scintillation at the receiver is produced by constructive and destructive interference 
of refracted and diffracted components of the broadcast signal.,
 All weather on Earth, from the surface of the planet out into space, begins with the Sun.  Space weather and terrestrial weather (the weather we feel at the surface) are influenced by the small changes 
the Sun undergoes during its solar cycle.  ,
 The most important impact the Sun has on Earth is from the brightness or irradiance of the Sun itself. The Sun produces energy in the form of photons of light. The variability of the Sun's output is wavelength 
dependent; different wavelengths have higher variability than others. Most of the energy from the Sun is emitted in the visible wavelengths (approximately 400 – 800 nanometers (nm)).  The output from the 
sun in these wavelengths is nearly constant and changes by only one part in a thousand (0.1%) over the course of the 11-year solar cycle.,
 At Ultraviolet or UV wavelengths (120 – 400 nm), the solar irradiance variability is larger over the course of the solar cycle, with changes up to 15%. This has a significant impact on the absorption 
of energy by ozone and in the stratosphere. At shorter wavelengths, like the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV), the Sun changes by 30% - 300% over very short timescales (i.e. minutes). These wavelengths are absorbed 
in the upper atmosphere so they have minimal impact on the climate of Earth. At the other end of the light spectrum, at Infrared (IR) wavelengths (800 – 10,000 nm), the Sun is very stable and only changes 
by a percent or less over the solar cycle.,
 The total wavelength-integrated energy from sunlight is referred to as the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). It is measured from satellites to be about 1365.5 Watts/m2 at solar minimum to 1366.5 Watts/m2 
at solar maximum. An increase of 0.1% in the TSI represents about 1.3 Watts/m2 change in energy input at the top of the atmosphere. This energy is scattered, reflected, and absorbed at various altitudes 
in the atmosphere, but the resulting change in the temperature of the atmosphere is measurable. It should be noted that the change in climate due to solar variability is likely small, but more research 
needs to be done.,
 There are other types of space weather that can impact the atmosphere. Energetic particles penetrate into the atmosphere and change the chemical constituents. These changes in minor species such as Nitrous 
Oxide (NO) can have long lasting consequences in the upper and middle atmosphere, however it has not been determined if these have a major impact on the global climate of Earth.,
 The duration of solar minimum may also have an impact on Earth's climate. During solar minimum there is a maximum in the amount of Cosmic rays, high energy particles whose source is outside our Solar 
system, reaching earth. There is a theory that cosmic rays can create nucleation sites in the atmosphere which seed cloud formation and create cloudier conditions. If this were true, then there would be 
a significant impact on climate, which would be modulated by the 11-year solar cycle.,
 Space weather impacts radio communication in a number of ways. At frequencies in the 1 to 30 mega Hertz range (known as “High Frequency” or HF radio), the changes in ionospheric density and structure 
modify the transmission path and even block transmission of HF radio signals completely. These frequencies are used by amateur (ham) radio operators and many industries such as commercial airlines. They 
are also used by a number of government agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Defense.,
 There are several types of space weather that can impact HF radio communication. In a typical sequence of space weather storms, the first impacts are felt during the solar flare itself. The solar x-rays 
from the sun penetrate to the bottom of the ionosphere (to around 80 km). There the x-ray photons ionize the atmosphere and create an enhancement of the D layer of the ionosphere. This enhanced D-layer 
acts both as a reflector of radio waves at some frequencies and an absorber of waves at other frequencies. The Radio Blackout associated with solar flares occurs on the dayside region of Earth and is most 
intense when the sun is directly overhead.,
 Another type of space weather, the Radiation Storm caused by energetic solar protons, can also disrupt HF radio communication. The protons are guided by Earth’s magnetic field such that they collide with 
the upper atmosphere near the north and south poles. The fast-moving protons have an affect similar to the x-ray photons and create an enhanced D-Layer thus blocking HF radio communication at high latitudes. 
During auroral displays, the precipitating electrons can enhance other layers of the ionosphere and have similar disrupting and blocking effects on radio communication. This occurs mostly on the night 
side of the polar regions of Earth where the aurora is most intense and most frequent.,
 NOAA’s CrowdMag is a crowdsourced data collection project that uses a mobile app to collect geomagnetic data from the magnetometers that modern smartphones use as part of their navigation systems. NCEI 
collects these data from citizen scientists around the world and provides quality control services before making them available through a series of aggregated maps and charts. These data have the potential 
to provide a high resolution alternative to geomagnetic satellite data, as well as near real-time information about changes in the magnetic field.,
 The CrowdMag Interactive Map shows crowdsourced magnetic data collected in the past 24 hours from the CrowdMag app. Data are updated hourly, and data points are snapped to the nearest grid points (following 
a roughly 1x1 kilometer grid) to ensure the privacy of data contributors.,
 Use the “+” sign in the upper right-hand on the map to display older data. The F channel represents Total Magnetic Field Strength, H channel represents the Magnetic Field’s Horizontal Component, and Z 
channel represents the Magnetic Field’s Vertical Component.,
 The NCEI Geomagnetism Group conducts original research on the Earth’s magnetic field. Our primary goal is to create up-to-date models that accurately track and depict changes to the geomagnetic field. 
Our magnetic models are integrated into millions of smartphones, car and aircraft navigation systems, and GPS so that users know which way is north.,
 The geomagnetic field changes with both time and location, and it needs to be monitored regularly to assess its impact on magnetic navigation. Scientists use ground-based observatories, data from satellites, 
and ship/airborne surveys to map the geomagnetic field and its changes, but these observation methods still leave significant coverage gaps. CrowdMag mobile apps are designed to help fill these gaps by 
using cell phone magnetometers to collect geomagnetic data.,
 Contributing data to CrowdMag is incredibly easy. Install the CrowdMag app, and use it to measure magnetic data along your path during walks, runs, or other outdoor activities. Data (\Magtivities\) can 
be used to create a map of the magnetic field in your area. We encourage you to share your data with the NCEI geomagnetism research group, and to take multiple measurements along the same path to improve 
data quality and resolution.CrowdMag’s magnetic calculator provides magnetic variation (declination), the magnetic field’s dip angle, the total magnetic field and other magnetic field components (as well 
as their associated uncertainties) based on the latest World Magnetic Model.,
 Getting a new phone? You can export your data to your computer before switching devices. Once your new phone is ready to go, you can import the backup data and continue using CrowdMag without losing your 
status for data contributed, areas covered, or magtivities completed.,
 The CrowdMag app now has a flight mode where you can collect magnetic data while you fly. Airplane observations fill in a large gap in magnetic data. Satellites can capture the biggest shapes of the magnetic 
field, and ground based observations can capture the smallest, but scientists aren’t able to capture observations between those extremes without aircraft. Help contribute to this project the next time 
you fly!,
 CrowdMag is a citizen science project that uses your mobile phone’s internal magnetometer to record magnetic data as you move. Anonymous data collected through the application can be used to detect magnetic 
anomalies caused by objects in the surrounding environment and also helps inform NOAA science.,
 In addition to the NOAA privacy policy, the CrowdMag app implements the following privacy measure to ensure that CrowdMag data are collected anonymously. We do not collect personally identifiable information, 
including your name, email address, or your device's unique identification number. If you enable the “send data” option in the CrowdMag app, the following information will be sent to NOAA:,
 CrowdMag data are stored in an internal, non-public database at NCEI. Our magnetic field research team will use these data to assess the utility of incorporating crowdsourced magnetic field data for modeling 
Earth’s magnetic field. Using CrowdMag data, our team will periodically produce scientific products such as maps, graphs and/or mathematical models. In order to further geomagnetic field research, these 
products may be presented at meetings, be included in publications, or be made available to the public via the Internet.,
 The High Definition Geomagnetic Model (HDGM) is a global, high resolution model of Earth's geomagnetic main and crustal field. The model provides magnetic field values (total field, dip, and declination) 
at any point above or below Earth's surface. The HDGM is updated annually to correctly model secular changes in the geomagnetic field.,
 HDGM Real-Time (RT) was developed by NOAA in partnership with the directional drilling industry and the University of Colorado. The RT version improves the base model by accurately modeling the magnetic 
fields originating in Earth's magnetosphere. It runs on input data from a combination of solar-wind observing satellites situated between Earth and sun and a chain of geomagnetic observatories on Earth's 
surface. ,
 The model also includes an ionospheric field model calculated from a combination of observatory and Swarm satellite data in order to represent the daily variations in the ionosphere. The addition of HDGM-RT 
can save rig-time and reduce the drilling cost by enabling improved drill string interference correction during adverse space weather conditions.,
 *Real-time modeling depends on live data streaming from observatories and satellites. Due to potential data linkage and corruption issues, a delay of real-time value calculations up to 2 hours is possible. 
Disturbance field is magnetospheric magnetic field and diurnal variation (ionospheric field at mid and low latitudes).,
 The error model is a scaled version of the magnetic error values provided in the Industry Steering Committee on Wellbore Survey Accuracy (ISCWSA) Measurement While Drilling (MWD) model (Reference: SPE 
67616). The multiplier was derived by comparing measured Total Magnetic Field Strength values with those predicted by the geomagnetic models. The Declination and Magnetic Dip angular values were checked 
to confirm the same multiplier was valid. The error values in the following table may be interpreted as one standard deviation difference between a hypothetical measurement and the calculator result for 
a location. More details of the scaling method is available in the paper SPE 151436.,
 For locations where magnetic survey data are not available, the HDGM software outputs the Standard ISCWSA model error, reflecting the lower resolution of the model at that location. See Figure 1 for HDGM’s 
magnetic data coverage (purple, see paper OTC-31044-MS).,
 *BH dependent error term. For example, the declination error of HDGM model in Boulder, CO (H = 20,800 nT) is calculated as √0.302 + (4118/20800)  2=36°. Standard model is defined as an annually updated 
geomagnetic model with a spherical harmonic degree and order of 50.,

 EMAG2 (Earth Magnetic Anomaly Grid 2-arc-minute resolution) is compiled from satellite, ship, and airborne magnetic measurements. Magnetic anomalies result from geologic features enhancing or depressing 
the local magnetic field. These maps increase knowledge of subsurface structure and composition of the Earth's crust. Global magnetic anomaly grids are used for resource exploration, navigation where GPS 
is unavailable (submarine, directional drilling, etc.), and studying the evolution of the lithosphere.,
 The latest EMAG2 (v3) includes more than 11.5M new ship and airborne track-line data, and several new or updated precompiled grids. While the previous EMAG2 relied on known or idealized local geology 
to interpolate anomalies into non-existent data areas, EMAG2 v3 relies solely on the data available. As a result, EMAG2 v3 better represents the complexity of these anomalies (particularly in oceanic regions) 
and accurately reflects areas where no data have been collected. The current version reports anomalies in two ways: A consistent altitude of 4km (referred to as Upward Continued) Anomaly altitude at Sea 
Level above oceanic regions and 4km above continental regions (referred to as Sea Level).,
 This version (2009) is a significant update over our first global magnetic anomaly grid, EMAG3. It relies on ocean age models to directionally grid anomaly data into areas where no data exists. The grid 
is reported at an altitude of 4km.,
 The global magnetic map illustrates Earth's evolution (plate tectonics and crustal interaction with the deep mantle). Distinct patterns and magnetic signatures are attributed to the formation (seafloor 
spreading) and destruction (subduction zones) of oceanic crust, and the formation of continental crust by accretion of various terrains to cratonic areas and large scale volcanism (both on continents and

 Electricity and the use of electricity for power and communication was still a relatively new technology in the late nineteenth century, so when strange things started happening on November 17, 1882, 
no one knew quite what to make of it. A few number of scientists had noticed the growing sunspot during the previous month, but at the time it had not yet been established that sun spots and solar flares 
were connected to magnetic disturbances on Earth and thus to the strange behavior of the newly-installed electric power and communication lines.,
 The following day, newspapers reported people hearing a “buzzing, ringing noise” in the telephone lines, telegraph lines not working, a Western Union office that “ignited half a dozen times”, and even 
“melted” telegraph equipment. Spectacular aurora was visible over many night-times skies. Even without Twitter or Instagram, stories about the odd events of the day quickly spread around the globe.,
 Some scientists believed that aurora and magnetic storms were somehow connected, but no one knew exactly what the connection was. We now know that they are caused by the interaction of the Earth with 
the sun. The Earth’s magnetic field is generated deep down in the Earth’s metallic core. This field imparts a force to the magnetized needles of compasses. The sun also has a magnetic field, one generated 
in its chaotic interior. The magnetic influence of the sun comes to the earth by way of an electrically conducting solar wind.,
 Normally, this wind is something of a light breeze, but sunspots and solar flares can cause strong gusts of solar wind. These bursts of energy interact with the earth’s magnetic field and can cause magnetic 
storms that interfere with electrical systems on the Earth, including power-lines and telephone and telegraph systems. Magnetic storms can also disturb simple compasses. We know about the November 1882 
storm from historical accounts, and also from data recorded at a magnetic observatory that had just been installed in Los Angeles.,
 Disturbances such as the November 1882 magnetic storm have occasionally occurred since then. Today, the U.S. Geological Survey monitors the Earth’s magnetic field using a network of 14 magnetic observatories 
that are situated across the United States and Territories. Data from these observatories enable scientists to understand magnetic storms and the hazard they represent for the operation of modern technological 
systems. Intense magnetic storms can disrupt radio signals, GPS systems used for navigation (think planes and boats), and power grids, sometimes causing wide-spread power outages. Monitoring the sun and 
the earth’s geomagnetic signals allows us to prepare for potential disruptions and prevent potential disasters in the future.,
 Jeffrey J. Love has been a research geophysicist since 2001 where he analyzes geomagnetic hazards of concern to the electric-power grid industry. Jeffrey is also interested in art, history, and home repair.,

 The Earth is associated with the geomagnetic field that hasan S (N) -pole of a magnet near the North (South) Pole.A magnetic compass, therefore, approximately points toward the north.However, the pointing 
direction is slightly different fromthe true north by an angle called \declination\.Also, two pairs of poles can be defined for the geomagnetic field:the geomagnetic poles and the magnetic poles.The magnetic 
north corresponds to neither pole, since the geomagnetic field actually has a more complicated shapethan a magnetic field generated by a bar magnet (See below).Moreover, a magnetic needle suspended at 
a center of balance does notkeep horizontal.As a rule, the N-pole dips downward by an angle called \inclination\in the northern hemisphere.,
 The Geomagnetic poles (dipole poles)are the intersections of the Earth's surfaceand the axis of a bar magnet hypothetically placed at the centerthe Earth by which we approximate the geomagnetic field.There 
is such a pole in each hemisphere, and the poles are called ashe geomagnetic north pole\ and he geomagnetic south pole\,respectively.On the other hand,the magnetic poles are the pointsat which magnetic 
needles become vertical.There also are he magnetic north pole\ and he magnetic south pole\.The geomagnetic or magnetic south (north) poles correspond tothe N (S) -pole of a magnet.In Table 1 and Figure 
1, we show predicted locations ofthe geomagnetic and magnetic poles by \International Geomagnetic Reference Field\(IGRF-13) from 1900 through 2025.These poles are drifting according to slow and smooth 
changein the geomagnetic field called he geomagnetic secular variation\.,
 In Figure 2, we show the predicteddeclination at Kyoto in 2020 by IGRF-13 in addition to the predicteddirections towards the geomagnetic and magnetic north poles.The reason why we have now westward declination 
in Japan isprobably due to the presence of a strong positive geomagnetic anomalyaround Lake Baikal in Siberia.The N-poles of magnetic needles tend to be attracted to the anomalyto show westward declinations 
around Japan.,
 In 1722 and 1723 a London clockmaker, George Graham, observed daily and consistent variations on one of his instruments, a “Needle upon the Pin” (a compass), for which he had no explanation. Swedish scientists 
obtained some of Graham’s instruments to record what is now known to be the variations in Earth’s magnetic field. In 1741, they noticed a significant deflection of the compass needle during an aurora, 
thus connecting auroral phenomena with the Earth’s magnetic field for the first time.,
 Fast-forward 250 years. A new very sensitive seismometer, an instrument used to record earthquakes, was installed in 1991 at the Black Forest Observatory (BFO, Schiltach Germany). This was, and still 
is, one of the quietest locations in the world, with little outside noise that could contaminate the ground signals recorded by the seismometer. And yet… on February 21, 1994 a strong magnetic storm that 
was recorded on magnetometers throughout the planet was also recorded on the BFO seismometer. What follows is a story about an unusual marriage between instruments used to measure what’s above us (Earth’s 
magnetic field) and instruments used to measure what’s below us (earthquakes).,
 An aurora is a colorful light display in the night sky mostly in the polar regions caused by the interaction between the solar winds and particles in the magnetosphere. These events in turn, influence 
the geomagnetic field that exists in the Earth, which in turn influence the electrical currents in the Earth (and in our built electrical systems, see Keeping the Lights On in North America.) The study 
of geomagnetic storms is driven both by scientific curiosity and also by the need to understand and mitigate the risk they pose to electrical grids.,
 Aaron Lojewski, a local resident, was driving on a dark road near Fairbanks, Alaska on February 2, 2019 just after midnight when the sky “erupted” with mostly pink colors. He stopped his car and took 
a photograph that was published in the local newspaper. This auroral event was one of three that were used by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and University of Alaska, Fairbanks scientists in one of two 
studies on the unusual connection between auroras, magnetometers (instruments that measure the Earth’s geomagnetic field), and seismometers (instruments that record the ground shaking during earthquakes). 
The space physicists and the seismologists were brought together by two different goals that turned out to have the same solution: 1) there are very few magnetometers around the world—and especially in 
remote arctic Alaska—because a geomagnetic observatory is very expensive; but we need more, and 2) there are a large number of seismometers around the world, and some of them record geomagnetic storms 
that are considered “noise” that needs to be removed.,
 Although it is well known that the ferro-magnetic material used in seismometers is sensitive to magnetic fluctuations, the exact influence had not been carefully analyzed. Geomagnetic signals are in the 
low frequency range, so seismic instruments that record in the low frequency range sometimes have a shield around them to block out the geomagnetic signals. But the shields are expensive, so they were 
not used on the 193 Transportable Array (TA) seismic stations that are currently in Alaska. The TA provided an excellent opportunity to observe the geomagnetic signal (“noise”) on this dense network in 
a region where space weather events (auroras) are frequent.,
 In one study, analysis of the data from the magnetometer and the seismometer at the permanent Global Seismographic Network (GSN) COLA station near Fairbanks showed that using a relatively inexpensive 
magnetometer to record the geomagnetic signal and then removing that “noise” from the seismic signal dramatically improved the seismic data. This approach worked for magnetometers up to 100-200km from 
the seismic station; variations of the geomagnetic field were too different from the seismometer location beyond that distance to be usable. During a magnetic storm, the magnetic signal is so strong compared 
to the background seismic signal that it can be detected on the seismometer. The COLA station is part of a network of 150 permanent seismometers around the world used by the USGS to locate earthquakes.,

 In the second study, the scientists used 6 all-sky cameras in Alaska that record optical data, in other words, photos of auroras; 8 magnetometer stations (several at the same sites as the cameras) to 
monitor space weather activity; and more than 200 seismic stations from the temporary TA stations and the permanent regional network in Alaska operated by the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. They focused 
on data from auroras on 3 different dates. The three different types of instruments all recorded the activity from the auroras, and the use of data from multiple seismometers allowed the seismic signal 
and the geomagnetic signal to be separated, providing geomagnetic data from locations where there were only seismometers.,
 In addition to the ability to use seismometers and inexpensive magnetometers to increase the density of data collected for geomagnetic activity, the GSN stations have 3 extra unused communication channels 
that could be used to send the geomagnetic data back to the central processing system immediately, providing additional realtime data to monitor space weather that may be negatively affecting power grids.,

 The outcome of the two studies results in a win-win situation for both seismologists and space physicists. Adding a relatively cheap magnetometer to each Alaska seismic station would result in better 
seismic data for earthquakes and also more geomagnetic data in real time for monitoring space weather.,

 Carl Tape grew up in Fairbanks, Alaska, and found his way back home in 2010. He develops and applies techniques in computational and observational seismology to obtain better images of Earth's internal 
structure and to obtain a better understanding of earthquakes. Improved seismic images can be used to help assess seismic hazard in earthquake-prone regions. While waiting for the next Alaska earthquake, 
he likes to explore the Alaskan Outdoors via running, hiking, and boating.,
 All magnetic objects produce invisible lines of force that extend between the poles of the object. Earth is similar to a giant bar magnet with magnetic field lines radiating from the south to the north 
magnetic pole. Charged particles become trapped on these field lines, forming the Earth's magnetosphere.,
 However, Earth's magnetic field lines are not symmetric with respect to its magnetic axis, unlike those of a bar magnet. The impact of a continuous stream of solar particles (the solar wind) causes the 
lines facing the Sun to be compressed. The field lines facing away from the Sun get stretched and elongated, forming the Earth's magnetotail. The bullet shaped magnetic bubble formed by the terrestrial 
magnetic field lines is called the Earth's magnetosphere. The magnetosphere extends into the vacuum of space, on average, from approximately 60 000 kilometres sunward, and trails out more than 300 000 
kilometres away from the Sun in the magnetotail.,
 The largely empty space between the planets is dominated by the solar wind - a stream of electrically charged particles (mainly electrons and protons) which are ejected at supersonic speeds by the Sun. 
Fortunately, the Earth's magnetic field is strong enough to protect our planet from this solar gale, usually preventing it from hitting the atmosphere or surface. However, a number of recognisable layers 
and boundaries can be observed in near-Earth space where the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field meet. These regions will be explored in great detail by Cluster.,
 The first sign of any interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field is a shock wave in space on the Sun-facing side of the Earth. This bow shock is rather like the sonic boom caused when 
a supersonic aircraft slows down and passes through the sound barrier. The Earth's bow shock is created when the supersonic solar wind is suddenly slowed as it approaches the planet's magnetic shield: 
the magnetosphere.,
 The edge of the magnetosphere is known as the magnetopause. When the Sun is more active, the increased pressure from the solar wind squashes the magnetosphere. At such times, the magnetopause is forced 
much closer to the Earth until it is only 35 000 kilometres above the planet instead of the average 60 000 kilometres.,
 However, there are two weak points in Earth's defences. These cusps occur above the planet's north and south magnetic poles. Particles from the solar wind which leak into the magnetosphere spiral down 
towards the Earth along magnetic field lines. When they strike atoms in the upper atmosphere, they cause the shimmering sheets of colour known as the auroras (northern and southern lights).,
 A “severe” storm occurred on June 21-23, 2015. This storm arose in response to variable solar-wind conditions that the Space Weather Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(SWPC, NOAA) associated with active region 2371 on the Sun. A series of 3 coronal mass ejections (CMEs) originated from this active region. These were subsequently recorded by NASA’s Advanced Composition 
Explorer (ACE) satellite, located on the Sun-Earth line at a distance approximately 1% of the distance from the Earth to the Sun, as abrupt enhancements in solar-wind velocity and density. With the arrival 
of the CMEs at the Earth on about June 21 16:45 UT, June 22 05:45 UT, and June 22 18:30 UT, concomitant increases in solar-wind ram pressure abruptly compressed the Earth’s magnetosphere. These generated 
eastward-flowing magnetopause electric currents and positive perturbations in the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field recorded at low-latitude magnetic observatories around the world, including 
at USGS observatories in Guam, Honolulu, and San Juan.,
 After the arrival at Earth of the third CME, ACE data indicate that the solar wind’s interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) was southward directed, an orientation that is optimal for connection of the IMF 
onto geomagnetic field lines. Once this connection occurred, the magnetosphere was effectively opened up to the solar wind, allowing electrically charged, energetic particles to be deposited into the magnetotail 
and into the westward-flowing equatorial ring current of the inner magnetosphere. This process is recorded at low-latitude magnetic observatories as a general “main-phase” diminishment in horizontal geomagnetic 
disturbance, the longitudinal average of which is the Dst index. This storm saw a maximum –Dst of 195 nT, realized on June 23 at about 04:30 UT and, so, by this measure this storm was slightly smaller 
than the St. Patrick’s day storm of March 17, 2015. Still, this storm is the second largest of this unusually subdued solar cycle. By comparison, in the last solar cycle, several storms had maximum –Dst 
exceeding 300 nT, and one exceeded 400 nT. The mid-latitude magnetic activity index Kp reached a value of 8 (one less than the maximum of 9).,
 As was typical for an intense storm, geomagnetic activity was particularly intense at high latitudes. For example, at the Barrow observatory on the north shore of Alaska, magnetic declination varied by 
about 10 degrees over the course of this storm. Aurora were seen across Alaska, Canada, and many states in the lower continental United States.,
 The storm attracted media attention, including reports published by the Washington Post, CBS News, NBC News, National Geographic, and Slate. A summary of this storm was also featured on the home page 
of the USGS.,
 A new report and map published by the U.S. Geological Survey provides critical insight to electric power grid operators across the northeastern United States in the event of a once-per-century magnetic 
superstorm.  ,
 Major metropolitan areas along the I-95 corridor – including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC – will benefit from the report’s geoelectrical hazard assessment, published in 
the journal Space Weather. ,
 “These new maps will allow states and utilities to better anticipate the threat and response to future magnetic storms across the northeast,” said Jim Reilly, director of the USGS. “They will prove useful 
for planning for future power-grid installations and will help utility companies develop strategies to mitigate blackouts and power system damage.”,
 Geomagnetic storms occasionally occur in the space environment surrounding the Earth due to the dynamic influence of the sun and the solar wind on the Earth’s geomagnetic field. On the Earth’s surface, 
magnetic storms can produce blackouts – for example, a storm in March 1989 caused a blackout of Quebec, Canada, and the northeastern United States. Even more concerning are the rare magnetic superstorms 
comparable to the “Carrington” storm of 1859, which today could cause blackouts on a continental scale and damage infrastructure that would not only be costly and time consuming to repair, but could potentially 
pose a threat to human safety.,
 The new USGS research shows that geological structure impacts the strength and direction of storm-generated geoelectric fields. In particular, USGS models show high geoelectric risk potential across the 
igneous and metamorphic rock of the Appalachian Mountains. In contrast, the sedimentary rock of Appalachian Plateau and Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain exhibits lower potential.,
 Adjusted geomagnetic data are magnetometer measurements with provisional correction factors applied such that vector quantities are oriented in a local Cartesian frame in which the X axis points north, 
the Y axis points east, and the Z axis points down. These correction factors are determined from so-called absolute measurements, which are “ground truth” observations made in the field using specialized 
magnetometers and survey equipment that are (nearly) colocated with the automated and continuously running magnetic measurement instrumentation. Correction factors can be substantial, up to hundreds of 
nanoTeslas, depending on the geologic and geomagnetic characteristics of the observatory site. They also tend to evolve over time because of instrument response instability and changing site characteristics. 
Historically, correction factors were determined offline, up to 1 year or more post-measurement, and applied to raw measurements to produce “Definitive” data for scientific analysis. Growing demand for 
corrected real-time geomagnetic data to better support space weather operations motivated development of an “Adjusted” geomagnetic data product. Modern computational tools, and some notable practical concerns, 
dictated a transition to affine transformations in lieu of more traditional baseline corrections, as well as a calibration parameter estimation algorithm that is more robust and statistically optimal, 
and therefore better suited for automated and unsupervised execution. A theoretical basis for this algorithm is presented, along with a demonstration and validation based on a comparison of results obtained 
with traditional techniques. Discrepancies between Definitive corrected data and near real-time Adjusted data obtained using affine transformations are minimal, generally much less than 5 nanoTeslas per 
vector component, and less than 1 nanoTesla for the total field magnitude, which satisfies International Real-Time Magnetic Observatory Network (INTERMAGNET) standards.,
 Submarine cables have become a vital component of modern infrastructure, but past submarine cable natural hazard studies have mostly focused on potential cable damage from landslides and tsunamis. A handful 
of studies examine the possibility of space weather effects in submarine cables. The main purpose of this study is to develop a computational model, using Python, of geomagnetic induction on submarine 
cables. The model is used to estimate the induced voltage in the submarine cables in response to geomagnetic disturbances. It also utilizes newly acquired knowledge from magnetotelluric studies and associated 
investigations of geomagnetically induced currents in power systems. We describe the Python-based software, its working principle, inputs/outputs based on synthetic geomagnetic field data, and compare 
its operational capabilities against analytical solutions. We present the results for different model inputs, and find: 1) the seawater layer acts as a shield in the induction process: the greater the 
ocean depth, the smaller the seafloor geoelectric field; and 2) the model is sensitive to the Ocean-Earth layered conductivity structure.,
 Geomagnetic perturbations (BGEO) related to magnetospheric ultralow frequency (ULF) waves induce electric fields within the conductive Earth—geoelectric fields (EGEO)—that in turn drive geomagnetically 
induced currents. Though numerous past studies have examined ULF wave BGEO from a space weather perspective, few studies have linked ULF waves with EGEO. Using recently available magnetotelluric impedance 
and EGEO measurements in the contiguous United States, we explore the relationship between ULF waves and EGEO. We use satellite, ground‐based radar, BGEO, and EGEO measurements in a case study of a plasmaspheric 
virtual resonance (PVR), demonstrating that the PVR EGEO has significant spatial variation in contrast to a relatively uniform BGEO, consistent with spatially varying Earth conductivity. We further show 
ULF wave EGEO measurements during two moderate storms of ∼1 V/km. We use both results to highlight the need for more research characterizing ULF wave EGEO.,
     We noticed that iron filings sprinkled upon a horizontal plane suspended above a pole of a dipole magnet do not appear to move when the magnet is rotated about the line extending between its two poles.,

     Your question is not a simple one, and has in the past confused quite a few people. A rough outline of the answer follows below; it is not exactly simple, and I can only hope that you and your son 
will have the patience to follow it to the end.,
       I take it you refer to the axially symmetric parts of the field. The observed field also has many irregularities, and these certainly rotate with the Earth. For instance, the north magnetic pole 
(and the south one, too) is separated by something like 1000 kilometers from the geographic pole, the pole around which the Earth rotates. And indeed, the magnetic  pole rotates every day a full 360° around 
the geographic one. What you have in mind--what your experiment involves--is something else: a symmetric field rotating around it s axis of symmetry.,
     If you have a source of magnetic field in empty space--iron magnet, coil--and you rotate it around an axis of symmetry, there is no extra effect, and therefore, nearby objects will not feel any force 
to make them share the rotation.  ,
       For instance, if you have a bar magnet and twirl it around its length, around the line connecting the poles, you get no observable change.  At any point in the surrounding space, the magnetic force 
sensed (say, by a compass needle) is not changed by the rotation. ,
       All that is true in empty space.  And to a very good approximation, it also holds if the space contains substances which do not conduct electric currents--air, wood, paper, glass etc. In all these 
cases, just having the source of magnetism rotate has no measurable effect. ,
        But if space is filled with a substance which can conduct electricity, and the rotating magnet also conducts electricity, the situation is different. Under certain conditions, electric currents 
may then be produced, and in that case, two effects are added:,
         Space around Earth--except for the lower atmosphere--does conduct electricity.  In the ionosphere--say 120 kilometers up (70 miles) and higher, sunlight rips off electrons from atoms, creating 
a \plasma,\ a mixture of free floating electrons and positive ions (left-over atoms, which miss an electron or more), and a plasma conducts electricity.  If a free electron collides with an ion, the two 
may recombine again--but densities are so low that in most regions recombination does not catch up with \ionization\ (the break up of atoms), even during the night, when the ripping-off of electrons stops. 
 Also, higher up in space additional sources of plasma exist, e.g the \solar wind\ blowing from the Sun.,
       Such magnetic forces try to make the plasma \co-rotate\ with the Earth. Their effect turns out to be the same as would occur,  if magnetic field lines which thread the plasma are viewed as attached 
to it. Then everything--Earth, plasma and field lines attached to it--rotate together. Once more--be aware that this only happens when space is filled with a good conductor of electricity.  Without electric 
conductivity, the magnetic field does not transmit rotation.  Iron does conduct electricity, but iron filings scattered on paper are not enough, they do not provide a good enough path for electric currents. 
,
     I guess this is about as far as one can go with an 8-year old.  As for the \simple experiments on magnetism\ you conduct with him, I would recommend three more, described in            http://www.phy6.org/earthmag/MagTeach.htm,

       For your own interest--if you want to know more about the way rotation CAN produce electric currents--look up the sections on dynamos in \The Great Magnet, the Earth\, home page               http://www.phy6.org/earthmag/demagint.htm,

     If you want to more about the way plasma moves together with magnetic field lines, look at the section on the magnetic field of the Sun, which is deformed by the Sun's uneven rotation.            
    http://www.phy6.org/earthmag/mill_5.htmA more elaborate example is found in                http://www.phy6.org/Education/wimproj.htmlAll that, however, is already quite a bit advanced.,
         Observationally, the finger was first pointed at Io because the radio emissions from Jupiter (even before space probes were sent to Jupiter) were known to be strongly dependent on the position 
of Io, not of any other moons.,
        Theoretically, we know Io has volcanoes and therefore an atmosphere and an ionosphere, and is the source of gas and ions around its orbit. I think these help conduct the electric current. Other 
moons do not have those features.94.    A Russian space tether experiment? ,
     Perhaps you would be so kind as to help me. I can find no trace of a Soviet space probe which, maybe ten years ago or more, attempted to collect and measure spatial electricity by means of a long 
trailing conductor. As I recall it failed because of a burn-out.,
     I know the earth's magnetic field blocks high energy radiation/protons from the sun, but why does it not block all radiation i.e.: visible light, UV light, infrared?  also, does the ability to block 
different wavelengths/energy levels depend on the strength of the field?,
       The reason, of course, is that the two are quite different. The bullets are chunks of matter, and to let them through, the matter of the armor has to give way, something it strenuously resists. 
The sound is a wave: the bullets make the armor oscillate and propagate the wave through it, without breaking its integrity.,
        Similarly with particles and electromagnetic radiation from the Sun (or from any source): they are completely different. The issue is confused by the fact that streams of high-energy particles 
are also popularly called \radiation,\ as in \radiation belts\ and \alpha-radiation\ (or \beta radiation\) from radioactive substances. There are historical reasons for this usage, but unfortunately, it 
is now too deeply rooted to be easily changed. ,
     Particles found in space carry an electric charge, and a moving electric charge can be viewed as equivalent to an electric current. Electric currents react to magnetic forces--in fact, magnetism may 
be viewed as interactions between electric currents--so it's no wonder charged particles get deflected, sometimes even trapped.,
       Light, X-rays, radio etc. are electromagnetic waves, wave-like disturbances propagating in space. They carry no electric charge, and in empty space they are not affected by magnetism. (When passing 
through matter they can be modified--e.g. light is refracted by glass--and that modification may strongly on magnetic fields, but that's a different case). What absorbs those waves is matter, e.g. atoms 
and molecules: when a wave encounters those, it may suddenly materialize as a compact \photon\ and deposit its energy.,
      Magnetic forces are more complicated.  Imagine you have a bar magnet.  A good approximation to its behavior is obtained by regarding it as a pair of \magnetic poles\, an \N-pole\ and an \S-pole.\ 
I won't use the words orth\ and \south,\ because they confuse people--see,
     Each pole is the source of magnetic force, which like the electric force from an electric charge (and like the force of gravity produced by some mass), weakens with distance R like 1/R2.,
       However, poles ALWAYS come in pairs, equal in strength but opposite in type. Their forces therefore interfere with each other--while one pole pulls, the other repels.  For that reason, at a great 
distance R, the magnetic field decreases with R at a faster rate, like 1/R3.,
       Intuition will tell you (and math confirms) that this interference--the mutual near-cancellation of push and pull--is greatest when the poles are close to each other, i.e. when the bar magnet is 
SHORT. The magnetic force produced by a bar magnet, at a given point in space, therefore depends on two factors--on both the strength Q of its poles, and on the distance D separating them.  The force is 
in fact proportional to the product M = QD ; of course it also depends on the distance R, and its direction depends on the angle between R and the axis of the bar magnet.,
     M is known as the \magnetic moment\ or \dipole moment\ of the magnet. Sorry it took so long to get so far, but I know of no simpler way.,
     Loops or coils carrying an electric current are also sources of magnetism, and such a loop or coil behaves (at a distance) like a small bar magnet (see wmfield.html). It turns out that the magnetic 
moment of a loop--i.e. of the bar magnet whose action it mimics--is proportional to the strength of the current flowing in it, times the area of the loop. A coil of (say) 20 turns multiplies that area 
20-fold. (All that, without adding any iron, which magnifies the effect).,
 The fire given off when burning for example, paper, wood, gasoline--is that another of the manifestations of a plasma?  If it isn't plasma that makes the fire shine--what is it?  ,
       Most flames are yellow. The main reason is that flames contain little bits of burned material--bits which later form its smoke--and they get hot enough to glow. Hot solid materials always glow--for 
instance, the filament in a lightbulb. However ,glowing in yellow light does not require a very hot temperature.,
      To create a plasma takes more energy, and requires a higher temperature than the flame provides. The collisions between atoms need to be energetic enough to kick an electron completely out of the 
atom. ,
       An electric arc welder drives a huge current across a narrow juncture where two pieces of metal touch, and that creates a temperature high enough to create a plasma. The surrounding air is also 
hot enough. After touching the two pieces can be separated, and the air continues to carry the electric current, and to heat enough to create the plasma. The metal tip glow so brightly (white light, with 
a lot of eye-damaging ultra-violet) that the welder can only view the work through a thick dark screen. ,
       Before writing to you, just to make sure, I took an electric meter and measured the resistance between two metal contacts separated by a small distance, putting both in the flame of a gas oven, 
which gets pretty hot. No electric current could be detected, both inside the flame and away from it, meaning the flame did not conduct any observable electric current.,
       Don't the magnetic field lines from the Sun need to close somewhere in space? Would such closing of field lines bring back the gyrating particles back to the Sun and give rise to a \reverse solar 
wind\?,
     Whether the magnetic field dominates the flow of a plasma, or the flow dominates the magnetic field, always depends on one question--what dominates the energy density, the plasma or the magnetic field? 
 ,
       If the field does, its structure is relatively rigid and it determines where particles can and cannot go. The inner radiation belt of Earth is a good example--dominated by the dipole structure of 
the Earth's field.,
       If the plasma has a higher energy density than the magnetic field, its flow is relatively undisturbed, and instead, it deforms the magnetic field to suit its motion. This is the case in the solar 
wind.,
     Because the solar wind dominates, it drags out solar magnetic field lines (as the above web site shows), in a spiral due to the Sun's rotation, which gets more and more circular.  The wind itself 
does not follow field lines but continues to move radially. (At the end of the above web page, however,  is a story of a different population of particles, high energy particles from an eruption on the 
Sun, which--because their number is few--do follow the field lines.),
     Ultimately the solar wind encounters interstellar plasma and magnetic fields, and undergoes a shock transition, where its density increases and its velocity drops, to less than the \Alfvén velocity\, 
a rarefied plasma's equivalent (in some ways) to the speed of sound.  That transition was crossed by Voyager 1 last December (see section #18B). Ultimately there exists another boundary, due to the interstellar 
magnetic field, and I am not sure what happens there, whether field lines temporarily interconnect with the outer field  or get tangled up. In either case, the solar wind does not come back, though it 
may end up deflected to move along the interface,
 Where would I find a drawing of magnetic lines of force of the whole solar system showing which go in to which planets and out to which other planets, or where they go, if nowhere then to other dimension?,

      Acording to your web site, the particles in the solar wind are leaving the Sun at about 400 km/s.  That is less than the escape velocity from the surface of the Sun, which is about 600 km/s.  Does 
it mean many of these particles will eventually fall back to the Sun?   Is there any evidence of such as behaviour?,
     Incidentally. NASA has been toying for years with the idea of a solar probe, approaching the Sun within 4 solar radii--following boost from a \hairpin\ orbit around Jupiter (mentioned briefly in  
           http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Stostars.htm,
     and in the page following it). It would be shielded from the Sun's intense heat by an \umbrella\ of tungsten or similar material, and would study the solar wind in its source region. How can it do 
so with a metal barrier between it and the Sun? Simple: at closest approach is moves at about 300 km/s, so in its own frame of reference, solar wind particles (unlike sunlight) would seem to come in from 
the side, at an angle. They would seem to have the vector sum of their own velocity and that of the corona relative to the fast-moving probe.  ,
      The Earth's magnetic field had diminished by some 10% since the mid 1800's. Isn't there a possibility that this has caused the magnetosphere's shielding effect to become diminished as well, thereby 
allowing more high speed radiation to penetrate our atmosphere. When, and if you find the time, I would appreciate your perspective on this possibility.,
      A question has been nagging me about eddy currents. They are never visualized the same way. Sometimes they are circling this direction, sometimes that, and sometimes there's just one big circle in 
the conductor they are being induced in.     I'm slowly beginning to  suspect that they are not circling at all, or at least that they are not aligned in any way. Is it because the visualizations are just 
some hand-waving argument, to help people imagine what really must be expressed by equations? Or am I browsing too many scripts meant to be read by electrical engineers? ,
      Hello Dr. Stern.    My most recent concern is the prophecy of a \doomsday\ for Earth in 2012. This prophecy states that the polar reversal and polar shift of the Earth will occur, causing destruction. 
Is the Earth due for another polar reversal in the near future? Or is this just a big myth? Also, I've heard about the Planet X, tenth planet of our solar system. Does this planet have an elliptical orbit 
that would collide with our Earth in 2012? Or is this Planet X a big myth? What are your thoughts on the Mayan Calendar ending in Dec 21 2012?,
       Why is it that  Earth some times behaves like a conductor and some times behaves like a dielectric (=insulator)? Please answer this question..   I am a student of telecommunication, from Pakistan.,

 High altitude pilots and astronauts can experience higher levels of radiation during magnetic storms, but the hazard is due to the radiation, not the magnetic field itself. Geomagnetism can also impact 
the electrically based technology that we rely on, but it does not impact people themselves. ,
 The mission of the U.S. Geological Survey's Geomagnetism Program is to monitor the Earth's magnetic field. Using ground-based observatories, the Program provides continuous records of magnetic field variations 
covering long timescales; disseminates magnetic data to various governmental, academic, and private institutions; and conducts research into the nature of geomagnetic variations for purposes,
 Solar flares and magnetic storms belong to a set of phenomena known collectively as \space weather\. Technological systems and the activities of modern civilization can be affected by changing space-weather 
conditions. However, it has never been demonstrated that there is a causal relationship between space weather and earthquakes. Indeed, over the course of the Sun's 11-year variable cycle, the occurrence 
of flares and magnetic storms waxes and wanes, but earthquakes occur without any such 11-year variability. Since earthquakes are driven by processes in the Earth's interior, they would occur even if solar 
flares and magnetic storms were to somehow cease occurring.
