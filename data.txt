 A new report and map published by the U.S. Geological Survey provides critical insight to electric power grid operators across the northeastern United States in the event of a once-per-century magnetic superstorm.  
 Major metropolitan areas along the I-95 corridor – including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC – will benefit from the report’s geoelectrical hazard assessment, published in the journal Space Weather. 
 “These new maps will allow states and utilities to better anticipate the threat and response to future magnetic storms across the northeast,” said Jim Reilly, director of the USGS. “They will prove useful for planning for future power-grid installations and will help utility companies develop strategies to mitigate blackouts and power system damage.”
 Geomagnetic storms occasionally occur in the space environment surrounding the Earth due to the dynamic influence of the sun and the solar wind on the Earth’s geomagnetic field. On the Earth’s surface, magnetic storms can produce blackouts – for example, a storm in March 1989 caused a blackout of Quebec, Canada, and the northeastern United States. Even more concerning are the rare magnetic superstorms comparable to the “Carrington” storm of 1859, which today could cause blackouts on a continental scale and damage infrastructure that would not only be costly and time consuming to repair, but could potentially pose a threat to human safety.
 The new USGS research shows that geological structure impacts the strength and direction of storm-generated geoelectric fields. In particular, USGS models show high geoelectric risk potential across the igneous and metamorphic rock of the Appalachian Mountains. In contrast, the sedimentary rock of Appalachian Plateau and Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain exhibits lower potential.
 Geomagnetic perturbations (BGEO) related to magnetospheric ultralow frequency (ULF) waves induce electric fields within the conductive Earth—geoelectric fields (EGEO)—that in turn drive geomagnetically induced currents. Though numerous past studies have examined ULF wave BGEO from a space weather perspective, few studies have linked ULF waves with EGEO. Using recently available magnetotelluric impedance and EGEO measurements in the contiguous United States, we explore the relationship between ULF waves and EGEO. We use satellite, ground‐based radar, BGEO, and EGEO measurements in a case study of a plasmaspheric virtual resonance (PVR), demonstrating that the PVR EGEO has significant spatial variation in contrast to a relatively uniform BGEO, consistent with spatially varying Earth conductivity. We further show ULF wave EGEO measurements during two moderate storms of ∼1 V/km. We use both results to highlight the need for more research characterizing ULF wave EGEO.
 A “severe” storm occurred on June 21-23, 2015. This storm arose in response to variable solar-wind conditions that the Space Weather Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (SWPC, NOAA) associated with active region 2371 on the Sun. A series of 3 coronal mass ejections (CMEs) originated from this active region. These were subsequently recorded by NASA’s Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite, located on the Sun-Earth line at a distance approximately 1% of the distance from the Earth to the Sun, as abrupt enhancements in solar-wind velocity and density. With the arrival of the CMEs at the Earth on about June 21 16:45 UT, June 22 05:45 UT, and June 22 18:30 UT, concomitant increases in solar-wind ram pressure abruptly compressed the Earth’s magnetosphere. These generated eastward-flowing magnetopause electric currents and positive perturbations in the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field recorded at low-latitude magnetic observatories around the world, including at USGS observatories in Guam, Honolulu, and San Juan.
 After the arrival at Earth of the third CME, ACE data indicate that the solar wind’s interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) was southward directed, an orientation that is optimal for connection of the IMF onto geomagnetic field lines. Once this connection occurred, the magnetosphere was effectively opened up to the solar wind, allowing electrically charged, energetic particles to be deposited into the magnetotail and into the westward-flowing equatorial ring current of the inner magnetosphere. This process is recorded at low-latitude magnetic observatories as a general “main-phase” diminishment in horizontal geomagnetic disturbance, the longitudinal average of which is the Dst index. This storm saw a maximum –Dst of 195 nT, realized on June 23 at about 04:30 UT and, so, by this measure this storm was slightly smaller than the St. Patrick’s day storm of March 17, 2015. Still, this storm is the second largest of this unusually subdued solar cycle. By comparison, in the last solar cycle, several storms had maximum –Dst exceeding 300 nT, and one exceeded 400 nT. The mid-latitude magnetic activity index Kp reached a value of 8 (one less than the maximum of 9).
 As was typical for an intense storm, geomagnetic activity was particularly intense at high latitudes. For example, at the Barrow observatory on the north shore of Alaska, magnetic declination varied by about 10 degrees over the course of this storm. Aurora were seen across Alaska, Canada, and many states in the lower continental United States.
 The storm attracted media attention, including reports published by the Washington Post, CBS News, NBC News, National Geographic, and Slate. A summary of this storm was also featured on the home page of the USGS.
 Submarine cables have become a vital component of modern infrastructure, but past submarine cable natural hazard studies have mostly focused on potential cable damage from landslides and tsunamis. A handful of studies examine the possibility of space weather effects in submarine cables. The main purpose of this study is to develop a computational model, using Python, of geomagnetic induction on submarine cables. The model is used to estimate the induced voltage in the submarine cables in response to geomagnetic disturbances. It also utilizes newly acquired knowledge from magnetotelluric studies and associated investigations of geomagnetically induced currents in power systems. We describe the Python-based software, its working principle, inputs/outputs based on synthetic geomagnetic field data, and compare its operational capabilities against analytical solutions. We present the results for different model inputs, and find: 1) the seawater layer acts as a shield in the induction process: the greater the ocean depth, the smaller the seafloor geoelectric field; and 2) the model is sensitive to the Ocean-Earth layered conductivity structure.
 Adjusted geomagnetic data are magnetometer measurements with provisional correction factors applied such that vector quantities are oriented in a local Cartesian frame in which the X axis points north, the Y axis points east, and the Z axis points down. These correction factors are determined from so-called absolute measurements, which are “ground truth” observations made in the field using specialized magnetometers and survey equipment that are (nearly) colocated with the automated and continuously running magnetic measurement instrumentation. Correction factors can be substantial, up to hundreds of nanoTeslas, depending on the geologic and geomagnetic characteristics of the observatory site. They also tend to evolve over time because of instrument response instability and changing site characteristics. Historically, correction factors were determined offline, up to 1 year or more post-measurement, and applied to raw measurements to produce “Definitive” data for scientific analysis. Growing demand for corrected real-time geomagnetic data to better support space weather operations motivated development of an “Adjusted” geomagnetic data product. Modern computational tools, and some notable practical concerns, dictated a transition to affine transformations in lieu of more traditional baseline corrections, as well as a calibration parameter estimation algorithm that is more robust and statistically optimal, and therefore better suited for automated and unsupervised execution. A theoretical basis for this algorithm is presented, along with a demonstration and validation based on a comparison of results obtained with traditional techniques. Discrepancies between Definitive corrected data and near real-time Adjusted data obtained using affine transformations are minimal, generally much less than 5 nanoTeslas per vector component, and less than 1 nanoTesla for the total field magnitude, which satisfies International Real-Time Magnetic Observatory Network (INTERMAGNET) standards.
 In 1722 and 1723 a London clockmaker, George Graham, observed daily and consistent variations on one of his instruments, a “Needle upon the Pin” (a compass), for which he had no explanation. Swedish scientists obtained some of Graham’s instruments to record what is now known to be the variations in Earth’s magnetic field. In 1741, they noticed a significant deflection of the compass needle during an aurora, thus connecting auroral phenomena with the Earth’s magnetic field for the first time.
 Fast-forward 250 years. A new very sensitive seismometer, an instrument used to record earthquakes, was installed in 1991 at the Black Forest Observatory (BFO, Schiltach Germany). This was, and still is, one of the quietest locations in the world, with little outside noise that could contaminate the ground signals recorded by the seismometer. And yet… on February 21, 1994 a strong magnetic storm that was recorded on magnetometers throughout the planet was also recorded on the BFO seismometer. What follows is a story about an unusual marriage between instruments used to measure what’s above us (Earth’s magnetic field) and instruments used to measure what’s below us (earthquakes).
 An aurora is a colorful light display in the night sky mostly in the polar regions caused by the interaction between the solar winds and particles in the magnetosphere. These events in turn, influence the geomagnetic field that exists in the Earth, which in turn influence the electrical currents in the Earth (and in our built electrical systems, see Keeping the Lights On in North America.) The study of geomagnetic storms is driven both by scientific curiosity and also by the need to understand and mitigate the risk they pose to electrical grids.
 Aaron Lojewski, a local resident, was driving on a dark road near Fairbanks, Alaska on February 2, 2019 just after midnight when the sky “erupted” with mostly pink colors. He stopped his car and took a photograph that was published in the local newspaper. This auroral event was one of three that were used by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and University of Alaska, Fairbanks scientists in one of two studies on the unusual connection between auroras, magnetometers (instruments that measure the Earth’s geomagnetic field), and seismometers (instruments that record the ground shaking during earthquakes). The space physicists and the seismologists were brought together by two different goals that turned out to have the same solution: 1) there are very few magnetometers around the world—and especially in remote arctic Alaska—because a geomagnetic observatory is very expensive; but we need more, and 2) there are a large number of seismometers around the world, and some of them record geomagnetic storms that are considered “noise” that needs to be removed.
 Although it is well known that the ferro-magnetic material used in seismometers is sensitive to magnetic fluctuations, the exact influence had not been carefully analyzed. Geomagnetic signals are in the low frequency range, so seismic instruments that record in the low frequency range sometimes have a shield around them to block out the geomagnetic signals. But the shields are expensive, so they were not used on the 193 Transportable Array (TA) seismic stations that are currently in Alaska. The TA provided an excellent opportunity to observe the geomagnetic signal (“noise”) on this dense network in a region where space weather events (auroras) are frequent.
 In one study, analysis of the data from the magnetometer and the seismometer at the permanent Global Seismographic Network (GSN) COLA station near Fairbanks showed that using a relatively inexpensive magnetometer to record the geomagnetic signal and then removing that “noise” from the seismic signal dramatically improved the seismic data. This approach worked for magnetometers up to 100-200km from the seismic station; variations of the geomagnetic field were too different from the seismometer location beyond that distance to be usable. During a magnetic storm, the magnetic signal is so strong compared to the background seismic signal that it can be detected on the seismometer. The COLA station is part of a network of 150 permanent seismometers around the world used by the USGS to locate earthquakes.
 In the second study, the scientists used 6 all-sky cameras in Alaska that record optical data, in other words, photos of auroras; 8 magnetometer stations (several at the same sites as the cameras) to monitor space weather activity; and more than 200 seismic stations from the temporary TA stations and the permanent regional network in Alaska operated by the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. They focused on data from auroras on 3 different dates. The three different types of instruments all recorded the activity from the auroras, and the use of data from multiple seismometers allowed the seismic signal and the geomagnetic signal to be separated, providing geomagnetic data from locations where there were only seismometers.
 In addition to the ability to use seismometers and inexpensive magnetometers to increase the density of data collected for geomagnetic activity, the GSN stations have 3 extra unused communication channels that could be used to send the geomagnetic data back to the central processing system immediately, providing additional realtime data to monitor space weather that may be negatively affecting power grids.
 The outcome of the two studies results in a win-win situation for both seismologists and space physicists. Adding a relatively cheap magnetometer to each Alaska seismic station would result in better seismic data for earthquakes and also more geomagnetic data in real time for monitoring space weather.

 Dynamic events on the Sun’s surface can affect the Earth and technological systems of importance to modern society. The charged particles of the solar wind interact with the geomagnetic field of the Earth’s surrounding space environment. Usually, this interaction is relatively subdued, but every once in a while the Sun emits a burst of solar wind that causes the temporary disturbance in the Earth’s magnetic field – a magnetic storm.
 Magnetic storms can wreak havoc on the electric power grids and communication lines. In September of 1859, a magnetic superstorm caused widespread interference to telegraph systems, even sparking fires at some telegraph stations. In March of 1989, an intense magnetic storm caused a black-out across Québec; in November of 2001 another storm caused the failure of electrical power transmission in New Zealand; and yet another in October of 2003, called the Halloween storm, brought significant interference to the power-grid system in Sweden. Several studies, including one issued by the National Academy of Sciences, suggest that the future occurrence of a magnetic superstorm could cause widespread blackouts that would carry a significant economic cost.
 A hazard is the probability that a dangerous natural phenomenon will occur in a given window of time, with a certain size, and in a given location. So, for example, a 100-year geoelectric hazard is the amplitude of the geoelectric field that is only attained or exceeded at a given location once per century on average. The 100-year geoelectric hazard level is the standard used by electric utility companies for investigating the resilience of their systems to the effects of rare, but very intense magnetic storms. Maps of 100-year geoelectric hazards assist utility company engineers as they examine which parts of distributed power-grid networks are more exposed, or, conversely, less exposed, to the deleterious effects of magnetic storms.
 The geoelectric hazard at any particular location depends on both the regional intensity of geomagnetic activity and on the electrical conductivity of the surrounding rock and deeper Earth material. To create a geoelectric hazard map, research scientists of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Geomagnetism Program analyze historical records of magnetic storms acquired at long-running magnetic observatories, including those operated by the USGS across the continental United States. This analysis is then combined with magnetotelluric measurements of the relationship between geomagnetic activity and the induced geoelectric field, such as those that have been made at various geographic sites across the continental United States as part of the National Science Foundation’s EarthScope project.
 Recently, Geomagnetism Program scientists have concentrated on regional mapping of geoelectric hazards across the Pacific Northwest and the Eastern United States. This work shows that geoelectric hazards maps are closely correlated with geologic structures. During a magnetic storm, conducting rock allow currents to flow in the Earth in response to a weak geoelectric field. These currents flow relatively easily through rock that is relatively electrically conductive, and less easily through rock that is relatively resistive. All of this means that, during a magnetic storm, electric currents, driven by geoelectric fields in the Earth, will tend to be diverted through electric power grids if they are situated atop the electrically resistive rock.
 By integrating the geoelectric field induced during a magnetic storm along a power-grid line, one can estimate the voltage on the line. During an intense magnetic storm, hundreds, and even thousands, of volts can be generated on long power lines. These voltages are not the carefully controlled alternating voltages provided by generating stations, and, indeed, geomagnetically induced voltages can drive uncontrolled currents on power grids that are of sufficient strength to damage transformers. If many transformers are damaged, as might happen during a magnetic superstorm, the result could be prolonged loss of electric power across a broad region of the United States.
 An important ongoing project of the USGS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is the real-time mapping of geoelectric fields across the continental United States. To accomplish this, real-time maps of the geomagnetic field, created using data from magnetic observatories, are combined with magnetotelluric survey measurements to estimate the time-varying geoelectric field. These geoelectric field maps will assist utility companies with their real-time operations – enabling the assessment of geoelectric hazards as they evolve over the course of a magnetic storm and helping power-grid managers to make decisions that may minimize the impact to their systems.

 Coronal holes appear as dark areas in the solar corona in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft x-ray solar images. They appear dark because they are cooler, less dense regions than the surrounding plasma and are regions of open, unipolar magnetic fields. This open, magnetic field line structure allows the solar wind to escape more readily into space, resulting in streams of relatively fast solar wind and is often referred to as a high speed stream in the context of analysis of structures in interplanetary space.
 Coronal holes can develop at any time and location on the Sun, but are more common and persistent during the years around solar minimum. The more persistent coronal holes can sometimes last through several solar rotations (27-day periods). Coronal holes are most prevalent and stable at the solar north and south poles; but these polar holes can grow and expand to lower solar latitudes. It is also possible for coronal holes to develop in isolation from the polar holes; or for an extension of a polar hole to split off and become an isolated structure. Persistent coronal holes are long-lasting sources for high speed solar wind streams. As the high speed stream interacts with the relatively slower ambient solar wind, a compression region forms, known as a co-rotating interaction region (CIR). From the perspective of a fixed observer in interplanetary space, the CIR will be seen to lead the coronal hole high speed stream (CH HSS).
 The CIR can result in particle density enhancement and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength increases preceding onset of the CH HSS. As the CH HSS begins to arrive at Earth, solar wind speed and temperature increase, while particle density begins to decrease. After passage of the CIR and upon transition into the CH HSS flow, the overall IMF strength will normally begin to slowly weaken.
 Generally, coronal holes located at or near the solar equator are most likely to result in any CIR passage and/or higher solar wind speeds at Earth. Strong CIRs and the faster CH HSS can impact Earth’s magnetosphere enough to cause periods of geomagnetic storming to the G1-G2 (Minor to Moderate) levels; although rarer cases of stronger storming may also occur. Geomagnetic storms are classified using a five-level NOAA Space Weather Scale. The larger and more expansive coronal holes can often be a source for high solar wind speeds that buffet Earth for many days.
 Because of their potential for escalated geomagnetic activity and possible storming (G1 or higher), forecasters analyze coronal holes closely and also note them on the daily synoptic drawing. SWPC forecasters take into account any possible effects of CIR and CH HSS activity when forecasting the anticipated levels of overall planetary geomagnetic response for each 3-hour synoptic period over the next three days; as detailed in the 3-day forecast. Additionally, any predicted CIR or CH HSS influences are explained in more detail in the forecast discussion.
 The electric power grid, and consequently the power to your home and business, can be disrupted by space weather.  One of the great discoveries of the 19th century was the realization that a time-varying magnetic field is able to produce an electrical current in a conducting wire.  The basic idea is that the time rate of change of the magnetic flux (i.e. lines of magnetic force) passing through a current loop is proportional to the current that is generated around the loop. A slightly earlier but equally important discovery was that a current-carrying wire produces a magnetic field.  The application of these principles is widely prevalent in modern society in electrical power generators, electrical power transformers, and electrical motors, for example.
 Time-varying magnetic fields and electrical current systems are not just artificial phenomena, but in fact are quite common in nature too.  Natural electrical current systems which vary in time can be found inside the Earth, in the oceans, and in the upper atmosphere of the earth (above ~100 km) where the constituents of the atmosphere include positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons which move about in a myriad of complicated ways.  Many of these upper atmospheric current systems are constantly present and modulate in a regular way in response to the rotation of the earth, the gravitational pull of the moon, and the slow variation of solar radiation over the course of the solar cycle.  At times, though, these current systems can be greatly enhanced and exhibit rapid changes with time and space, a phenomenon typically referred to as a geomagnetic storm.  Geomagnetic storms in turn are caused by disturbances that propagate away from the Sun, travel through interplanetary space and interact with Earth’s space environment.
 We might expect that the early inventors of the telegraph systems did not realize that the electrical circuit they were constructing was threaded by lines of naturally produced magnetic flux, and, even more surprising, that this flux could vary with time and induce a natural current in their system.  It was not too long after their deployment, though, that reports of anomalous currents were observed which could at times prohibit communication or could enable a system to be run without an electrical power source, or in more dramatic instances cause the recording paper to catch fire (see review by Boteler 2003 and references therein).  Similar effects continued to be noticed from time to time with the next generation of communication lines (coaxial cables).
 Another system of artificial electrical circuits began to grow with the advent of electrical power systems. Just like the telegraphs, this complicated collection of circuits is threaded by naturally produced magnetic flux and just like the telegraphs, rapid variations of this magnetic flux during geomagnetic storms causes a naturally produced current to flow through the system.  This effect was first reported after the 24 March 1940 geomagnetic storm (Davidson, 1940; see also Germaine, 1940 for reports of effects on long-line communication cables).  Numerous large and moderate impacts to the grid have been reported over the years, including a power blackout in 1958 (Lanzerotti & Gregori, 1986), equipment tripping and voltage stability issues (4 August 1972), a nine-hour blackout in Canada and a transformer loss (13 March 1989 - see photo), and a blackout in Sweden during the October 2003 storm. (See Boteler, 2001, for a comprehensive compilation of effects).
 Assessing the impact of geomagnetic storms on the electrical power grid involves a number of considerations.  The path for current flow that responds to the varying external currents in the upper atmosphere follows artificial current paths on the ground (the power lines) as well as various natural current paths (e.g. conducting structures below the ground and nearby bodies of water).  Once the natural current paths are accounted for, the net geoelectric field that is imposed on the artificial current paths results in a quasi D.C. (periods of 10 seconds to 10’s (tens) of minutes) current in the power lines.  These geomagnetically induced currents cause the ‘exciting current’ in power transformers to operate out of their designed range, resulting in saturation of the magnetic core material inside the transformer.  Once the core saturates, the transformer no longer provides any back ‘electromotive force’ (a kind of electrical inertia) and the currents and voltages in the windings become abnormally large. Depending on the transformer design, this can lead to heating of the surrounding structures due to induced ‘Eddy Currents’ which has the potential to damage parts of the transformer.  An additional impact of transformer saturation is that the voltages and currents no longer have a simple sinusoidal (60 cycle) form and this can cause protective equipment elsewhere in the grid to trip when it shouldn’t.  These equipment ‘trips’ can take needed equipment off line and cause voltage stability problems.  An additional issue for the system is that all of the transformers that are saturating show up as a significant inductive load on the grid as a whole.  This means that a system that is near peak levels of demand prior to the geomagnetic storm event may not be able to meet the total power demand when the geomagnetic storm occurs, leading to partial or system wide blackouts.

 The Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) and Aurora Australis (Southern Lights) are the result of electrons colliding with the upper reaches of Earth’s atmosphere. (Protons cause faint and diffuse aurora, usually not easily visible to the human eye.) The electrons are energized through acceleration processes in the downwind tail (night side) of the magnetosphere and at lower altitudes along auroral field lines. The accelerated electrons follow the magnetic field of Earth down to the Polar Regions where they collide with oxygen and nitrogen atoms and molecules in Earth’s upper atmosphere. In these collisions, the electrons transfer their energy to the atmosphere thus exciting the atoms and molecules to higher energy states. When they relax back down to lower energy states, they release their energy in the form of light. This is similar to how a neon light works. The aurora typically forms 80 to 500 km above Earth’s surface.
 Earth’s magnetic field guides the electrons such that the aurora forms two ovals approximately centered at the magnetic poles. During major geomagnetic storms these ovals expand away from the poles such that aurora can be seen over most of the United States. Aurora comes in several different shapes. Often the auroral forms are made of many tall rays that look much like a curtain made of folds of cloth. During the evening, these rays can form arcs that stretch from horizon to horizon. Late in the evening, near midnight, the arcs often begin to twist and sway, just as if a wind were blowing on the curtains of light. At some point, the arcs may expand to fill the whole sky, moving rapidly and becoming very bright. This is the peak of what is called an auroral substorm.
 Then in the early morning the auroral forms can take on a more cloud-like appearance. These diffuse patches often blink on and off repeatedly for hours, then they disappear as the sun rises in the east. The best place to observe the aurora is under an oval shaped region between the north and south latitudes of about 60 and 75 degrees. At these polar latitudes, the aurora can be observed more than half of the nights of a given year.
 When space weather activity increases and more frequent and larger storms and substorms occur, the aurora extends equatorward. During large events, the aurora can be observed as far south as the US, Europe, and Asia. During very large events, the aurora can be observed even farther from the poles. (Tips on viewing the aurora and maps of the typical extent of the aurora). Of course, to observe the aurora, the skies must be clear and free of clouds. It must also be dark so during the summer months at auroral latitudes, the midnight sun prevents auroral observations. Photo by Neal Brown (Fairbanks)
 All weather on Earth, from the surface of the planet out into space, begins with the Sun.  Space weather and terrestrial weather (the weather we feel at the surface) are influenced by the small changes the Sun undergoes during its solar cycle.  
 The most important impact the Sun has on Earth is from the brightness or irradiance of the Sun itself. The Sun produces energy in the form of photons of light. The variability of the Sun's output is wavelength dependent; different wavelengths have higher variability than others. Most of the energy from the Sun is emitted in the visible wavelengths (approximately 400 – 800 nanometers (nm)).  The output from the sun in these wavelengths is nearly constant and changes by only one part in a thousand (0.1%) over the course of the 11-year solar cycle.
 At Ultraviolet or UV wavelengths (120 – 400 nm), the solar irradiance variability is larger over the course of the solar cycle, with changes up to 15%. This has a significant impact on the absorption of energy by ozone and in the stratosphere. At shorter wavelengths, like the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV), the Sun changes by 30% - 300% over very short timescales (i.e. minutes). These wavelengths are absorbed in the upper atmosphere so they have minimal impact on the climate of Earth. At the other end of the light spectrum, at Infrared (IR) wavelengths (800 – 10,000 nm), the Sun is very stable and only changes by a percent or less over the solar cycle.
 The total wavelength-integrated energy from sunlight is referred to as the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). It is measured from satellites to be about 1365.5 Watts/m2 at solar minimum to 1366.5 Watts/m2 at solar maximum. An increase of 0.1% in the TSI represents about 1.3 Watts/m2 change in energy input at the top of the atmosphere. This energy is scattered, reflected, and absorbed at various altitudes in the atmosphere, but the resulting change in the temperature of the atmosphere is measurable. It should be noted that the change in climate due to solar variability is likely small, but more research needs to be done.
 There are other types of space weather that can impact the atmosphere. Energetic particles penetrate into the atmosphere and change the chemical constituents. These changes in minor species such as Nitrous Oxide (NO) can have long lasting consequences in the upper and middle atmosphere, however it has not been determined if these have a major impact on the global climate of Earth.
 The duration of solar minimum may also have an impact on Earth's climate. During solar minimum there is a maximum in the amount of Cosmic rays, high energy particles whose source is outside our Solar system, reaching earth. There is a theory that cosmic rays can create nucleation sites in the atmosphere which seed cloud formation and create cloudier conditions. If this were true, then there would be a significant impact on climate, which would be modulated by the 11-year solar cycle.
 The use of single and dual frequency satellite radio navigation systems, like the Global Positioning System (GPS), has grown dramatically in the last decade. GPS receivers are now in nearly every cell phone and in many automobiles, trucks, and any equipment that moves and needs precision location measurements. High precision dual frequency GPS systems are used for farming, construction, exploration, surveying, snow removal and many other applications critical to a functional society. Other satellite navigation systems in orbit include the European Galileo system and the Russian GLONASS system.
 There are several ways in which space weather impacts GPS function. GPS radio signals travel from the satellite to the receiver on the ground, passing through the Earth’s ionosphere. The charged plasma of the ionosphere bends the path of the GPS radio signal similar to the way a lens bends the path of light. In the absence of space weather, GPS systems compensate for the “average” or “quiet”  ionosphere, using a model to calculate its effect on the accuracy of the positioning information. But when the ionosphere is disturbed by a space weather event, the models are no longer accurate and the receivers are unable to calculate an accurate position based on the satellites overhead.
 In calm conditions, single frequency GPS systems can provide position information with an accuracy of a meter or less. During a severe space weather storm, these errors can increase to tens of meters or more. Dual frequency GPS systems can provide position information accurate to a few centimeters. In this case the two different GPS signals are used to better characterize the ionosphere and remove its impact on the position calculation. But when the ionosphere becomes highly disturbed, the GPS receiver cannot lock on the satellite signal and position information becomes inaccurate.
 Geomagnetic storms create large disturbances in the ionosphere. The currents and energy introduced by a geomagnetic storm enhance the ionosphere and increase the total height-integrated number of ionospheric electrons, or the Total Electron Count (TEC). GPS systems cannot correctly model this dynamic enhancement and errors are introduced into the position calculations. This usually occurs at high latitudes, though major storms can produce large TEC enhancements at mid-latitudes as well.
 Near the Earth’s magnetic equator there are current systems and electric fields that create instabilities in the ionosphere. The instabilities are most severe just after sunset. These smaller scale (tens of kilometers) instabilities, or bubbles, cause GPS signals to “scintillate”, much like waves on the surface of a body of water will disrupt and scatter the path of light as it passes through them. Near the equator, dual frequency GPS systems often lose their lock due to “ionospheric scintillation”. Ionospheric scintillations are not associated with any sort of space weather storm, but are simply part of the natural day-night cycle of the equatorial ionosphere.
 The F10.7 Index has proven very valuable in specifying and forecasting space weather.   Because it is a long record, it provides climatology of solar activity over six solar cycles.  Because it comes from the chromosphere and corona of the sun, it tracks other important emissions that form in the same regions of the solar atmosphere.   The Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) emissions that impact the ionosphere and modify the upper atmosphere track well with the F10.7 index.  Many Ultra-Violet emissions that affect the stratosphere and ozone also correlate with the F10.7 index.  And because this measurement can be made reliably and accurately from the ground in all weather conditions, it is a very robust data set with few gaps or calibration issues.
 Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) are the slowly varying, highly energetic background source of energetic particles that constantly bombard Earth. GCR originate outside the solar system and are likely formed by explosive events such as supernova. These highly energetic particles consist of essentially every element ranging from hydrogen, accounting for approximately 89% of the GCR spectrum, to uranium, which is found in trace amounts only. These nuclei are fully ionized, meaning all electrons have been stripped from these atoms. Because of this, these particles interact with and are influenced by magnetic fields. The strong magnetic fields of the Sun modulate the GCR flux and spectrum at Earth.
 Over the course of a solar cycle the solar wind modulates the fraction of the lower-energy GCR particles such that a majority cannot penetrate to Earth near solar maximum. Near solar minimum, in the absence of many coronal mass ejections and their corresponding magnetic fields, GCR particles have easier access to Earth. Just as the solar cycle follows a roughly 11-year cycle, so does the GCR, with its maximum, however, coming near solar minimum. But unlike the solar cycle, where bursts of activity can change the environment quickly, the GCR spectrum remains relatively constant in energy and composition, varying only slowly with time. (See Forbush decrease for short-term changes of GCR related to space strong solar events)
 These charged particles are traveling at large fractions of the speed of light and have tremendous energy. When these particles hit the atmosphere, large showers of secondary particles are created with some even reaching the ground. These particles pose little threat to humans and systems on the ground, but they can be measured with sensitive instruments. The Earth’s own magnetic field also works to protect Earth from these particles largely deflecting them away from the equatorial regions but providing little-to-no protection near the polar regions or above roughly 55 degrees magnetic latitude (magnetic latitude and geographic latitude differ due to the tilt and offset of the Earth’s magnetic field from its geographic center). This constant shower of GCR particles at high latitudes can result in increased radiation exposures for aircrew and passengers at high latitudes and altitudes. Additionally, these particles can easily pass through or stop in satellite systems, sometimes depositing enough energy to result in errors or damage in spacecraft electronics and systems.
 The Ionosphere is part of Earth’s upper atmosphere, between 80 and about 600 km  where Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) and x-ray  solar radiation ionizes the atoms and molecules thus creating a layer of electrons.  the ionosphere is important because it reflects and modifies radio waves used for communication and navigation. Other phenomena such as energetic charged particles and cosmic rays  also have an ionizing effect and can contribute to the ionosphere.
 The atmospheric atoms and molecules are impacted by the high energy the EUV and  X-ray photons from the sun.  The amount of energy (photon flux) at EUV and x-ray wavelengths varies by nearly a factor of ten over the 11 year solar cycle.  The density of the ionosphere changes accordingly.  Due to spectral variability of the solar radiation and the density of various constituents in the atmosphere, there are layers are created within the ionosphere, called the D, E, and F-layers. Other solar phenomena, such as flares, and changes in the solar wind and geomagnetic storms also effect the charging of the ionosphere.  Since the largest amount of ionization is caused by solar irradiance, the night-side of the earth, and the pole pointed away from the sun (depending on the season) have much less ionization than the day-side of the earth, and the pole pointing towards the sun.
 Satellite communication refers to any communication link that involves the use of an artificial satellite in its propagation path. Satellite communications play a vital role in modern life. There are over 2000 artificial satellites in use. They can be found in geostationary, Molniya, elliptical, and low Earth orbits and are used for traditional point-to-point communications, mobile applications, and the distribution of TV and radio programs. For a brief history of satellite communications see: https://www.britannica.com/technology/satellite-communication​. For details on communication satellite orbits and satellite communication applications see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite.
 Satellite communications tend to use high frequency signals: Ultra High Frequency (UHF), 300 MHz - 3 GHz and Super High Frequency (SHF), 3 - 30 GHz. Radio signals propagating to and from a satellite in orbit are affected by the environmental conditions along the propagation path. In a vacuum, radio signals propagate at the speed of light, but in the presence of plasma in the ionosphere, the signals are affected by group delay and phase advance and attenuation due to absorption and scintillation. The environment's effect on the signal is frequency dependent and to a first approximation is proportional to the amount of structure in the plasma present along the propagation path.
 Due to ionospheric variability (Space Weather), the effects on propagating signals are highly variable. Up to some level, the effects of Space Weather on propagation can be mitigated through engineering design solutions, but space weather can lead to a total loss of communication due to attenuation and/or severe scintillation when the broadcast signals cross the ionosphere. In trans-ionosphere propagation, scintillation refers to the rapid variation of the amplitude and phase of a received signal. Scintillation is produced by structure in the ionosphere. The severity of scintillation depends on the frequency of the used signal and the spatial structure of plasma density and plasma drifts along the propagation path. Specifically, scintillation at the receiver is produced by constructive and destructive interference of refracted and diffracted components of the broadcast signal.
 Space weather impacts radio communication in a number of ways. At frequencies in the 1 to 30 mega Hertz range (known as “High Frequency” or HF radio), the changes in ionospheric density and structure modify the transmission path and even block transmission of HF radio signals completely. These frequencies are used by amateur (ham) radio operators and many industries such as commercial airlines. They are also used by a number of government agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Defense.
 There are several types of space weather that can impact HF radio communication. In a typical sequence of space weather storms, the first impacts are felt during the solar flare itself. The solar x-rays from the sun penetrate to the bottom of the ionosphere (to around 80 km). There the x-ray photons ionize the atmosphere and create an enhancement of the D layer of the ionosphere. This enhanced D-layer acts both as a reflector of radio waves at some frequencies and an absorber of waves at other frequencies. The Radio Blackout associated with solar flares occurs on the dayside region of Earth and is most intense when the sun is directly overhead.
 Another type of space weather, the Radiation Storm caused by energetic solar protons, can also disrupt HF radio communication. The protons are guided by Earth’s magnetic field such that they collide with the upper atmosphere near the north and south poles. The fast-moving protons have an affect similar to the x-ray photons and create an enhanced D-Layer thus blocking HF radio communication at high latitudes. During auroral displays, the precipitating electrons can enhance other layers of the ionosphere and have similar disrupting and blocking effects on radio communication. This occurs mostly on the night side of the polar regions of Earth where the aurora is most intense and most frequent.
 The magnetosphere is the region of space surrounding Earth where the dominant magnetic field is the magnetic field of Earth, rather than the magnetic field of interplanetary space. The magnetosphere is formed by the interaction of the solar wind with Earth’s magnetic field. This figure illustrates the shape and size of Earth’s magnetic field that is continually changing as it is buffeted by the solar wind. 
 It has been several thousand years since the Chinese discovered that certain magnetic minerals, called lodestones, would align in roughly the north-south direction. The reason for this effect wasn’t understood, though, until 1600, when William Gilbert published De Magnete and demonstrated that our Earth behaved like a giant magnet and loadstones were aligning with Earth’s magnetic field. 
 After several more centuries of investigation, it is now known that Earth’s magnetic field is quite complex, but still, to a great extent, can be viewed as a dipole, with north and south poles like a simple bar magnet. Earth’s magnetic axis, the dipole, is inclined at about 11 degrees to Earth’s spin axis. If space were a vacuum, Earth’s magnetic field would extend to infinity, getting weaker with distance, but in 1951, while studying why comet tails always point away from the sun, Ludwig Biermann discovered that the sun emits what we now call the solar wind. This continuous flow of plasma, comprised of mostly electrons and protons, with an embedded magnetic field, interacts with Earth and other objects in the solar system. 
 The pressure of the solar wind on Earth’s magnetic field compresses the field on the dayside of Earth and stretches the field into a long tail on the nightside. The shape of the resulting distorted field has been compared to the appearance of water flowing around a rock in a stream. On the dayside of Earth, rather than extending to infinity, the magnetic field is confined to within about 10 Earth radii from the center of Earth and on the nightside, the field is stretched out to hundreds of Earth radii, well beyond the orbit of the moon at 60 Earth radii.
 The boundary between the solar wind and Earth’s magnetic field is called the magnetopause. The boundary is constantly in motion as Earth is buffeted by the ever-changing solar wind. While the magnetopause shields us to some extent from the solar wind, it is far from impenetrable, and energy, mass, and momentum are transferred from the solar wind to regions inside Earth’s magnetosphere. The interaction between the solar wind and Earth’s magnetic field, and the influence of the underlying atmosphere and ionosphere, creates various regions of fields, plasmas, and currents inside the magnetosphere such as the plasmasphere, the ring current, and radiation belts. The consequence is that conditions inside the magnetosphere are highly dynamic and create what we call “space weather” that can affect technological systems and human activities. For example, the radiation belts can have impacts on the operations of satellites, and particles and currents from the magnetosphere can heat the upper atmosphere and result in satellite drag that can affect the orbits of low-altitude Earth orbiting satellites. Influences from the magnetosphere on the ionosphere can also affect communication and navigations systems. All of these effects are discussed elsewhere in more detail.
 Drag is a force exerted on an object moving through a fluid, and it is oriented in the direction of relative fluid flow. Drag acts opposite to the direction of motion and tends to slow an object. As an example, think of running against a high wind and feeling the drag pushing you back in the direction of relative fluid flow. This same force acts on spacecraft and objects flying in the space environment. Drag has a significant impact on spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO), generally defined as an orbit below an altitude of approximately 2,000 kilometers (1,200 mi). Although the air density is much lower than near the Earth’s surface, the air resistance in those layers of the atmosphere where satellites in LEO travel is still strong enough to produce drag and pull them closer to the Earth (Figure 1, shown above, the region of the Earth’s atmosphere where atmospheric drag is an important factor perturbing spacecraft orbits.(NASA/GSFC)). The International Space Station (ISS) and the Hubble Space Telescope are examples of spacecraft operating in LEO.
 The drag force on satellites increases during times when the Sun is active. When the Sun adds extra energy the atmosphere the low density layers of air at LEO altitudes rise and are replaced by higher density layers that were previously at lower altitudes. As a result, the spacecraft now flies through the higher density layer and experiences a stronger drag force. When the Sun is quiet, satellites in LEO have to boost their orbits about four times per year to make up for atmospheric drag. When solar activity is at its greatest over the 11-year solar cycle, satellites may have to be maneuvered every 2-3 weeks to maintain their orbit [1].
 In addition to these long-term changes in upper atmospheric temperature and density caused by the solar cycle, interactions between the solar wind and the Earth’s magnetic field during geomagnetic storms can produce large short-term increases in upper atmosphere temperature and density, increasing drag on satellites and changing their orbits. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) has to re-identify hundreds of objects and record their new orbits after a large solar storm event (Figure 2). During the March 1989 storm event, for example, the NASA's Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) spacecraft was reported to have \dropped as if it hit a brick wall\ due to the increased atmospheric drag.
 It is extremely important to keep track of spacecraft and objects flying in the space to avoid collisions with space junk and orbital debris that may be in their path. Collision avoidance has become of increasing concern due to the recent accidental hypervelocity collision of two intact spacecraft in February, 2009. The collision occurred at an altitude of 790 km, leaving pieces of debris that have been gradually separated into different orbital planes around the Earth, threatening other satellites for the next few decades. Since 1957, more than 25,000 artificial space debris have been cataloged (Figure 3), many of which have naturally decayed into the lower atmosphere. Currently, the U.S. Space Surveillance Network (SSN) tracks over 20,000 man-made objects larger than 10 cm in size, which are known as the “catalogued” population. Debris between 1 cm and 10 cm (approximately 500,000), referred to as the “lethal” population, are the most concerning as they cannot be tracked or cataloged and can cause catastrophic damage when colliding with a satellite. Objects smaller than 1 cm (approximately 135 million measuring from 1mm to 1cm, and many more smaller than 1 mm) that could disable a satellite upon impact are termed the “risk” population [3].
 Figure 3. Thousands of manmade objects—95 % of them “space junk”— occupy low Earth orbit. Each black dot in this image shows either a functioning satellite, an inactive satellite, or a piece of debris. Although the space near Earth looks crowded, each dot is much larger than the satellite or debris it represents, and collisions are extremely rare. (NASA illustration courtesy Orbital Debris Program Office.)
 The consequences of a spacecraft collision with debris can range from performance degradation to failure and satellite fragmentation. In LEO, debris as small as a few millimeters in diameter can puncture unprotected fuel lines and damage sensitive components, while debris smaller than 1 mm in diameter can erode thermal surfaces and damage optics. Although smaller objects can partly be mitigated through the use of meteor bumpers, such as on the ISS, the only way to mitigate larger objects impact is to maneuver the spacecraft to avoid collision. Such maneuvers are expensive, impact the operation of sensitive experiments on board, and ideally should only be done if the chance of collision is high. To assess the risk, and mitigate the likelihood of collision, the SSN monitors these objects and predicts their orbits about three days ahead.
 Orbit propagation models are used to determine the location of space objects in the relatively near-term (typically over a period of a few days or less) for purposes of collision avoidance or re-entry predictions, and also to make long-term predictions (typically over a period of years) about the debris environment. Both short- and long-term propagation models must take into account the various forces acting on space objects in Earth’s orbit including atmospheric drag. Since accurate orbit propagation models that include all forces acting on an orbiting object can be very computation intensive, most models take into account only the forces that most strongly affect the space objects in particular orbital regions. The primary forces acting on a space object in LEO are atmospheric drag and gravitational attraction of the Earth [4].
 The largest uncertainty in determining orbits for satellites operating in low Earth orbit is the atmospheric drag. Drag is the most difficult force to model mainly because of the complexity of neutral atmosphere variations driven by the Sun, and the propagation from below of lower atmosphere waves [5, 6]. Atmospheric neutral density models routinely used in orbit determination applications are mainly empirical. These models are based on historical observations to which parametric equations have been fitted, representing the known variations of the upper atmosphere with local time, latitude, season, solar and geomagnetic activity [7, 8, 9]. First-principle (or physics-based) models can also provide information about the atmospheric density conditions. Unlike empirical models, first principles physics models seek to calculate a physical quantity starting directly from established laws of physics without making assumptions such as empirical or fitted parameters. Taking into account the interactions between upper atmosphere winds, composition and densities, first-principle models are able to provide a realistic representation of neutral density in the upper atmosphere if the magnitude, spatial distribution, and temporal evolution of the solar sources can be defined with sufficient accuracy, especially in long-duration magnetic storm events [10].
 Going to the CTIPe web page shows a simulation using the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere-plasmasphere electrodynamics (CTIPe; https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/ctipe-total-electron-content-forecast) physics-based model [11], illustrates the increase in atmospheric density at 400km altitude during the occurrence of a large magnetic storm on May 15, 2005, as a satellite (represented by the black diamond) flies through. The atmospheric density is given in Kg/m3. As the time progresses, the satellite will encounter denser air following the beginning of the magnetic storm (starting around 06:00 Universal Time). As the storm comes to end, atmospheric density slowly goes back to quiet conditions.

 Solar flares and magnetic storms belong to a set of phenomena known collectively as \space weather\. Technological systems and the activities of modern civilization can be affected by changing space-weather conditions. However, it has never been demonstrated that there is a causal relationship between space weather and earthquakes. Indeed, over the course of the Sun's 11-year variable cycle, the occurrence of flares and magnetic storms waxes and wanes, but earthquakes occur without any such 11-year variability. Since earthquakes are driven by processes in the Earth's interior, they would occur even if solar flares and magnetic storms were to somehow cease occurring.
 Electromagnetic variations have been observed after earthquakes, but despite decades of work, there is no convincing evidence of electromagnetic precursors to earthquakes. It is worth acknowledging that geophysicists would actually love to demonstrate the reality of such precursors, especially if they could be used for reliably predicting earthquakes!

 High altitude pilots and astronauts can experience higher levels of radiation during magnetic storms, but the hazard is due to the radiation, not the magnetic field itself. Geomagnetism can also impact the electrically based technology that we rely on, but it does not impact people themselves. 
 Yes. There is evidence that some animals, like sea turtles and salmon, have the ability to sense the Earth's magnetic field (although probably not consciously) and to use this sense for navigation.
 The mission of the U.S. Geological Survey's Geomagnetism Program is to monitor the Earth's magnetic field. Using ground-based observatories, the Program provides continuous records of magnetic field variations covering long timescales; disseminates magnetic data to various governmental, academic, and private institutions; and conducts research into the nature of geomagnetic variations for purposes
 EMAG2 (Earth Magnetic Anomaly Grid 2-arc-minute resolution) is compiled from satellite, ship, and airborne magnetic measurements. Magnetic anomalies result from geologic features enhancing or depressing the local magnetic field. These maps increase knowledge of subsurface structure and composition of the Earth's crust. Global magnetic anomaly grids are used for resource exploration, navigation where GPS is unavailable (submarine, directional drilling, etc.), and studying the evolution of the lithosphere.
 The latest EMAG2 (v3) includes more than 11.5M new ship and airborne track-line data, and several new or updated precompiled grids. While the previous EMAG2 relied on known or idealized local geology to interpolate anomalies into non-existent data areas, EMAG2 v3 relies solely on the data available. As a result, EMAG2 v3 better represents the complexity of these anomalies (particularly in oceanic regions) and accurately reflects areas where no data have been collected. The current version reports anomalies in two ways: A consistent altitude of 4km (referred to as Upward Continued) Anomaly altitude at Sea Level above oceanic regions and 4km above continental regions (referred to as Sea Level).
 This version (2009) is a significant update over our first global magnetic anomaly grid, EMAG3. It relies on ocean age models to directionally grid anomaly data into areas where no data exists. The grid is reported at an altitude of 4km.
 The global magnetic map illustrates Earth's evolution (plate tectonics and crustal interaction with the deep mantle). Distinct patterns and magnetic signatures are attributed to the formation (seafloor spreading) and destruction (subduction zones) of oceanic crust, and the formation of continental crust by accretion of various terrains to cratonic areas and large scale volcanism (both on continents and oceans).
 There are numerous indices of magnetic activity. The International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) officially recognizes magnetic indices aa, Am, Kp, Dst, and AE. More information about the IAGA indices is available from the International Services for Geomagnetic Indices (ISGI).
 A simple global index of magnetic activity is produced in France from the K indices of two nearly antipodal magnetic observatories in England and Australia. This index aa, is the 3-hourly equivalent amplitude antipodal index. Daily average AA may be derived similarly to Ap. An historical advantage to using aa rather than ap is that these indices have been extended back in time through scaling of magnetic activity from magnetograms of earlier observations. The aa indices are derived from 1868 to the present. An AA* index has been derived that is the counterpart of Ap* but is available for a longer span of years. However, the AA* is derived from indices from only two magnetic observatories whereas Ap* incorporates indices from more observatories.
 Because of the difference in units of presentation, the values of AA* and Ap* are not the same so that different major magnetic storm onset and end threshold values are used for the two series. However their comparison for the years of overlapping coverage show that relative frequency of occurrence of major storms per year are similar. Another reason for differences is that an index derived from magnetic perturbation values at only two observatories easily experiences larger extreme values if either input site is well situated to the overhead ionospheric and.or field aligned current systems producing the magnetic storm effects. Although not documented here, it is interesting to note that the overall level of magnetic disturbance from year to year has increased substantially from a low around 1900 Also, the level of mean yearly aa is now much higher so that a year of minimum magnetic disturbances now is typically more disturbed than years at maximum disturbance levels before 1900.
 The Auroral Electrojet Index, AE, is designed to provide a global, quantitative measure of auroral zone magnetic activity produced by enhanced Ionospheric currents flowing below and within the auroral oval. Ideally, It is the total range of deviation at an instant of time from quiet day values of the horizontal magnetic field (h) around the auroral oval. Defined and developed by Davis and Sugiura [1966], AE has been usefully employed both qualitatively and quantitatively as a correlative index in studies of substorm morphology, the behavior of communication satellites, radio propagation, radio scintillation, and the coupling between the interplanetary magnetic field and the earth's magnetosphere. For these varied uses, AE possesses advantages over other geomagnetic indices or at least shares their advantageous properties:
 These indices were and are derived in response to indications of need as voiced by the scientific user community in journal articles, at meetings in resolutions of national and international groups, and in personal communications.
 Ap* is defined as the earliest occurring maximum 24-hour value obtained by computing an 8-point running average of successive 3-hour ap indices during a geomagnetic storm event without regard to the starting and ending times of the UT-day. It is uniquely associated with the storm event. Over many years, values of Ap* provide a maximum disturbance measure useful to identify major geomagnetic storms chronologically (by date and start time) and by amplitude from largest to the smallest. The earliest possible values are for 1932, because that is the first year for which the standard Kp and ap indices were produced. As NGDC staff or others have time to update Ap*, tables of values are available from 1932 to recent times. 
 DST (Disturbance Storm Time) equivalent equatorial magnetic disturbance indices are derived from hourly scaling's of low-latitude horizontal magnetic variation. They show the effect of the globally symmetrical westward flowing high altitude equatorial ring current, which causes the \main phase\ depression worldwide in the H-component field during large magnetic storms. This diskette contains the hourly indices for the period 1 Jan 1957 through 30 Sep 1992, as derived by M. Sugiura and T. Kamei, WDC-C2 for Geomagnetism, Faculty of Science, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606, Japan.
 Hourly H-component magnetic variations are analyzed to remove annual secular change trends from records of a worldwide array of low-latitude observatories. A cosine factor of the site latitude transforms residual variations to their equatorial equivalents and harmonic analysis isolates the term used as the DST index. Sugiura described DST derivation in ANNALS OF THE IGY.
 Partial and symmetric magnetospheric ring currents, magnetopause, neutral sheet and tail currents generate a magnetic disturbance field which is monitored by the global network of magnetic observatories. The dominant axi-symmetric part of this disturbance field is estimated from the recordings at four low-latitude observatories and is distributed by the World Data Centers as the Dst index.
 Further separating the disturbance magnetic field into external and induced contributions provides the Est index for the external source field and the Ist index for the internal induced field. (Ref: Maus, Stefan; Weidelt, Peter; Separating the magnetospheric disturbance magnetic field into external and transient internal contributions using a 1D conductivity model of the Earth; Geophys. Res. Lett., Vol. 31, No. 12, L12614)
 The physical motivation for this separation is that the time varying magnetospheric fields induce electric currents in the Earth which in turn give rise to a secondary internal field whose strength is roughly one third of the external field. Hence, the disturbance field observed at the Earth's surface is the sum of the external source field and its induced counterpart. If the Earth were an ideal conductor then the two fields would be exactly in phase because currents would be induced in such a way as to prevent any external field from entering into the conductor.
 Furthermore, for an ideal conductor the strength of the induced field would be such that its radial component would cancel the radial component of the inducing field everywhere on its surface. For the real Earth, however, the phase lag and amplitude relation between the induced internal and inducing external field depends on the frequency content of the external source field.
 Daily regular magnetic field variation arise from current systems caused by regular solar radiation changes. Other irregular current systems produce magnetic field changes caused by the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere, by the magnetosphere itself, by the interactions between the magnetosphere and ionosphere, and by the ionosphere itself.
 The K-index is quasi-logarithmic local index of the 3-hourly range in magnetic activity relative to an assumed quiet-day curve for a single geomagnetic observatory site. First introduced by J. Bartels in 1938, it consists of a single-digit 0 thru 9 for each 3-hour interval of the universal time day (UT).
 The planetary 3-hour-range index Kp is the mean standardized K-index from 13 geomagnetic observatories between 44 degrees and 60 degrees northern or southern geomagnetic latitude. The scale is O to 9 expressed in thirds of a unit, e.g. 5- is 4 2/3, 5 is 5 and 5+ is 5 1/3. This planetary index is designed to measure solar particle radiation by its magnetic effects. The 3-hourly ap (equivalent range) index is derived from the Kp index as follows:
 Other planetary indices include the Ap* and AA*. The Ap* index is defined as the earliest occurring maximum 24-hour value obtained by computing an 8-point running average of successive 3-hour ap indices during a geomagnetic storm event and is uniquely associated with the storm event. The AA* index is similar to the Ap* index, but has a longer history and is based on reports from only two stations.
 Magnetic poles are commonly understood as positions on Earth's surface where the geomagnetic field is vertical (i.e., perpendicular) to the ellipsoid. These north and south positions, called dip poles, do not need to be (and are not currently) antipodal. In principle, the dip poles can be found by conducting a magnetic survey to determine where the field is vertical. In practice, the geomagnetic field is vertical on oval-shaped loci traced on a daily basis, with considerable variation from one day to the next. Other definitions of geomagnetic poles depend on the way the poles are computed from a geomagnetic model.
 It has been long understood that dip poles migrate over time. In 1831, James Clark Ross located the north dip pole position in northern Canada. Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) tracked the North Magnetic Pole, which is slowly drifting across the Canadian Arctic, by periodically carrying out magnetic surveys to reestablish the Pole's location from 1948 to 1994. An international collaboration, led by a French fundraising association, Poly-Arctique, and involving NRCan, Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris and Bureau de Recherche Geologique et Miniere, added two locations of the North Magnetic Pole in 2001 and 2007. The most recent survey determined that the Pole is moving approximately north-northwest at 55km per year.
 Geomagnetic field models can also define geomagnetic poles. The geomagnetic poles, or geocentric dipole, can be computed from the first three Gauss coefficients from a main field model, such as the World Magnetic Model (WMM) or International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF). The WMM representation of the field includes a magnetic dipole at the center of Earth. This dipole defines an axis that intersects Earth's surface at two antipodal points called geomagnetic poles. Based on the WMM2020 coefficients for 2020.0, the Geomagnetic North Pole is at 72.68°W longitude and 80.37°N latitude, and the Geomagnetic South Pole is at 107.32°E longitude and 80.37°S latitude. The axis of the dipole is currently inclined at 9.41° to Earth's rotation axis. The same dipole is the basis for the simple geomagnetic coordinate system of geomagnetic latitude and longitude. 
 Scientists, map makers, and polar explorers have an interest in the locations of the dip and geomagnetic poles. Although geomagnetic pole positions cannot be observed, they are arguably of greater significance than the dip poles because the auroral ovals (approximate 5° latitude bands where the spectacular aurora is likely visible) are closely centered on the geomagnetic poles. They are usually displaced slightly to the night-side of the geomagnetic poles and greatly vary in size: bands of greatest activity occur between 15° and 25° from the geomagnetic poles.
 GM POLE is a program that can compute the locations of the geomagnetic poles from January 1900–December 2015 using a linear interpolation of the dipole Gauss coefficients from the geomagnetic reference field models (see file ALL-IGRF.TAB below). This program uses a computational method devised by Fraser-Smith (1987) and originally coded by W.H. Campbell. New version coded by Adam Woods. 
 The magnetic poles or dip poles are computed from all the Gauss coefficients using an iterative method. Magnetic poles derived in this fashion are geographically closer to the experimentally observed poles. Based on the current WMM, the 2020 location of the North Magnetic Pole is 86.50°N and 164.04°E and the South Magnetic Pole is 64.07°S and 135.88°E.
 The International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) is a standard mathematical description of the Earth's main magnetic field. It is used widely in studies of the Earth's deep interior, crust, ionosphere, and magnetosphere. While this web page is hosted at NOAA/NCEI, the model itself is developed and maintained by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA).
 The coefficients for the 13th generation of IGRF model were finalized by an IAGA task force in December 2019. The IGRF is the product of a collaborative effort between magnetic field modelers and the institutes involved in collecting and disseminating magnetic field data collected from satellites, observatories, and surveys around the world. Please review the Model Health Warning before using the IGRF.
 The software code is in the public domain and not licensed or under copyright. The information and software may be used freely by the public. As required by 17 U.S.C. 403, third parties producing copyrighted works consisting predominantly of the material produced by U.S. government agencies must provide notice with such work(s) identifying the U.S. Government material incorporated and stating that such material is not subject to copyright protection.
 Older versions of the IGRF may be required in special cases. For example, if a magnetic survey was conducted in 1983, the appropriate predictive IGRF-3 (available at that time) would have been subtracted to make an anomaly map. If the original data are no longer available to update the map, add the IGRF-3 to the anomaly map and then subtract IGRF-13 which includes the required definitive magnetic reference field (DGRF) model for 1980–1985.
 The IGRF is a series of mathematical models of the Earth's main field and its annual rate of change (secular variation). In source-free regions at the Earth's surface and above, the main field, with sources internal to the Earth, is the negative gradient of a scalar potential V which can be represented by a truncated series expansion:
 Here, a = 6371.2 km and the degree of truncation is N = 13. The 13th Generation IGRF coefficients were computed from candidate sets of coefficients produced by the participating members of IAGA Working Group V-MOD. Their institutes and the many organizations involved in operating magnetic survey satellites, observatories, magnetic survey programs and World Data Centers are to be thanked for their continuing support of the IGRF project.
 The High Definition Geomagnetic Model (HDGM) is a global, high resolution model of Earth's geomagnetic main and crustal field. The model provides magnetic field values (total field, dip, and declination) at any point above or below Earth's surface. The HDGM is updated annually to correctly model secular changes in the geomagnetic field.
 HDGM Real-Time (RT) was developed by NOAA in partnership with the directional drilling industry and the University of Colorado. The RT version improves the base model by accurately modeling the magnetic fields originating in Earth's magnetosphere. It runs on input data from a combination of solar-wind observing satellites situated between Earth and sun and a chain of geomagnetic observatories on Earth's surface. 
 The model also includes an ionospheric field model calculated from a combination of observatory and Swarm satellite data in order to represent the daily variations in the ionosphere. The addition of HDGM-RT can save rig-time and reduce the drilling cost by enabling improved drill string interference correction during adverse space weather conditions.
 *Real-time modeling depends on live data streaming from observatories and satellites. Due to potential data linkage and corruption issues, a delay of real-time value calculations up to 2 hours is possible. Disturbance field is magnetospheric magnetic field and diurnal variation (ionospheric field at mid and low latitudes).
 The error model is a scaled version of the magnetic error values provided in the Industry Steering Committee on Wellbore Survey Accuracy (ISCWSA) Measurement While Drilling (MWD) model (Reference: SPE 67616). The multiplier was derived by comparing measured Total Magnetic Field Strength values with those predicted by the geomagnetic models. The Declination and Magnetic Dip angular values were checked to confirm the same multiplier was valid. The error values in the following table may be interpreted as one standard deviation difference between a hypothetical measurement and the calculator result for a location. More details of the scaling method is available in the paper SPE 151436.
 For locations where magnetic survey data are not available, the HDGM software outputs the Standard ISCWSA model error, reflecting the lower resolution of the model at that location. See Figure 1 for HDGM’s magnetic data coverage (purple, see paper OTC-31044-MS).
 *BH dependent error term. For example, the declination error of HDGM model in Boulder, CO (H = 20,800 nT) is calculated as √0.302 + (4118/20800)  2=36°. Standard model is defined as an annually updated geomagnetic model with a spherical harmonic degree and order of 50.

 Magnetic declination (sometimes called magnetic variation) is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Declination is positive when this angle is east of true north and negative when it is west. Magnetic declination changes over time, and with location. Declination value is needed to determine true north, because compasses point toward magnetic north.
 You can compute the true bearing from a magnetic bearing by adding the magnetic declination to the magnetic bearing. This works as long as you follow the convention that degrees west are negative (i.e. a magnetic declination of 10-degrees west is -10 and bearing of 45-degrees west is -45). Some example case illustrations are provided for an east magnetic declination and a west magnetic declination.
 NOAA’s CrowdMag is a crowdsourced data collection project that uses a mobile app to collect geomagnetic data from the magnetometers that modern smartphones use as part of their navigation systems. NCEI collects these data from citizen scientists around the world and provides quality control services before making them available through a series of aggregated maps and charts. These data have the potential to provide a high resolution alternative to geomagnetic satellite data, as well as near real-time information about changes in the magnetic field.
 The CrowdMag Interactive Map shows crowdsourced magnetic data collected in the past 24 hours from the CrowdMag app. Data are updated hourly, and data points are snapped to the nearest grid points (following a roughly 1x1 kilometer grid) to ensure the privacy of data contributors.
 Use the “+” sign in the upper right-hand on the map to display older data. The F channel represents Total Magnetic Field Strength, H channel represents the Magnetic Field’s Horizontal Component, and Z channel represents the Magnetic Field’s Vertical Component.
 The NCEI Geomagnetism Group conducts original research on the Earth’s magnetic field. Our primary goal is to create up-to-date models that accurately track and depict changes to the geomagnetic field. Our magnetic models are integrated into millions of smartphones, car and aircraft navigation systems, and GPS so that users know which way is north.
 The geomagnetic field changes with both time and location, and it needs to be monitored regularly to assess its impact on magnetic navigation. Scientists use ground-based observatories, data from satellites, and ship/airborne surveys to map the geomagnetic field and its changes, but these observation methods still leave significant coverage gaps. CrowdMag mobile apps are designed to help fill these gaps by using cell phone magnetometers to collect geomagnetic data.
 Contributing data to CrowdMag is incredibly easy. Install the CrowdMag app, and use it to measure magnetic data along your path during walks, runs, or other outdoor activities. Data (\Magtivities\) can be used to create a map of the magnetic field in your area. We encourage you to share your data with the NCEI geomagnetism research group, and to take multiple measurements along the same path to improve data quality and resolution.\nCrowdMag’s magnetic calculator provides magnetic variation (declination), the magnetic field’s dip angle, the total magnetic field and other magnetic field components (as well as their associated uncertainties) based on the latest World Magnetic Model.
 Getting a new phone? You can export your data to your computer before switching devices. Once your new phone is ready to go, you can import the backup data and continue using CrowdMag without losing your status for data contributed, areas covered, or magtivities completed.
 The CrowdMag app now has a flight mode where you can collect magnetic data while you fly. Airplane observations fill in a large gap in magnetic data. Satellites can capture the biggest shapes of the magnetic field, and ground based observations can capture the smallest, but scientists aren’t able to capture observations between those extremes without aircraft. Help contribute to this project the next time you fly!
 CrowdMag is a citizen science project that uses your mobile phone’s internal magnetometer to record magnetic data as you move. Anonymous data collected through the application can be used to detect magnetic anomalies caused by objects in the surrounding environment and also helps inform NOAA science.
 In addition to the NOAA privacy policy, the CrowdMag app implements the following privacy measure to ensure that CrowdMag data are collected anonymously. We do not collect personally identifiable information, including your name, email address, or your device's unique identification number. If you enable the “send data” option in the CrowdMag app, the following information will be sent to NOAA:
 CrowdMag data are stored in an internal, non-public database at NCEI. Our magnetic field research team will use these data to assess the utility of incorporating crowdsourced magnetic field data for modeling Earth’s magnetic field. Using CrowdMag data, our team will periodically produce scientific products such as maps, graphs and/or mathematical models. In order to further geomagnetic field research, these products may be presented at meetings, be included in publications, or be made available to the public via the Internet.
 The World Magnetic Model (WMM) is the standard model for navigation, altitude, and heading referencing systems using the geomagnetic field. Additional WMM uses include civilian applications, including navigation and heading systems.
 The model is a joint product of the United States’ National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the United Kingdom’s Defence Geographic Centre (DGC). NCEI and the British Geological Survey (BGS) jointly developed the WMM. The U.S. Department of Defense, the U.K. Ministry of Defence, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) use the WMM.
 The model, associated software, and documentation are distributed by NCEI on behalf of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). The model is produced at 5-year intervals, with the current model expiring on December 31, 2024.
 Download links first take you to a voluntary survey page. We request that you complete the survey to receive up to date information about WMM via email. Your feedback will strengthen the WMM program.
 NCEI provides access to the DoD software and current WMM and WMM online calculator. The software computes the main components of the geomagnetic field and their annual changes. The programs are designed to be used in demand mode. The software is available as C source code. The model file, WMM.COF (format specification), is available in the same directory as the software. \n Note:The altitude is referenced to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) ellipsoid. The WMM software library provides functions to convert height above mean sea level (AMSL) to height above WGS 84. This option is enabled by default.
 Annual change, also known as Secular Variation (SV) in each of these magnetic components, is also displayed. The annual change is computed by subtracting the main field values for the desired input date from main field values one year later. The output units are displayed using the abbreviations nT (nanoTesla), deg (degrees) and min (minutes) per year. The new WMM2020 software also outputs uncertainty for each component. The error is one standard deviation difference between a hypothetical measurement and model output. The uncertainty values have the same units as their corresponding components.

 Several users have ported the WMM C or Fortran programs to other languages and have kindly offered to share these programs. Only non-commercial \free-ware\ will be linked from this site. Linking to third-party software does not imply an endorsement or review of any kind from the Federal Government. Users are encouraged to verify results based on the WMM test values.
 Note: Because WMM is a \predictive only\ model, we do not make the older models (WMM.COF files) widely available. We recommend using the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) models for years prior to 2015. IGRF is updated retrospectively to provide the best available estimate of the geomagnetic field back to 1900.
 The modular C WMM software reads the coefficient file, WMM.COF, and computes the geomagnetic field at the user-specified location. The download file is always the latest version. This software for the WMM is developed as a C sub-library that can be incorporated into other applications and software. We use a modular programming approach to facilitate reuse in other applications. We also provide wrapper programs to produce single point, time series, and grid values of the magnetic field. The core numerical functions are optimized for speed and efficiency.
 The geoid implementation of the WMM software references the altitude of the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) ellipsoid. This is generally called height above ellipsoid (HAE). However, WMM users may be more familiar with the height above mean sea level (AMSL). The difference between AMSL and HAE varies with location and the total variation is less than 200 meters. The software allows users to enter their altitude above the mean sea level rather than their height above ellipsoid. Conversion between heights referenced to MSL and WGS84 ellipsoid was implemented using the EGM96 geoid.
 The correction results in a difference of magnetic field strength of about 1-3 nT. The largest differences in magnetic field strength coincide with the largest deviations of the geoid from the WGS-84 ellipsoid. However, the effect of geoid height correction is negligible in the magnetic declination. The EGM-96 geoid height file will also be supplied with the WMM package for this purpose. This option is enabled by default.
 The software accurately computes the associated Legendre functions up to degree 2,800, making it adaptable for high-degree geomagnetic models. Details of the WMMWorld Magnetic Model derivation are described in The US/UK World Magnetic Model for 2020-2025: Technical Report.
 This calculator provides annual change, also known as secular variation (SV), for each of these magnetic components. Annual change is computed by subtracting the main field values for the desired input date from main field values one year later. The output units are displayed using the abbreviations nT (nanoTesla), deg (degrees) and min (minutes) per year.
 WMM2020 software also provides uncertainty and estimated error for each component. The error is one standard deviation difference between a hypothetical measurement and model output. The uncertainty values have the same units as their corresponding components.
 This web calculator will produce output for a grid of points for a range of dates. It outputs as either XML or CSV. Select the WMM2020 radio button to get results from the World Magnetic Model.
 This web calculator will give declination for a single point. If HTML output is selected it includes a Google map with sample compass. Select the WMM2020 radio button to get results from the World Magnetic Model.
 Contour maps were created for each of the seven magnetic elements (D, I, H, X, Y, Z, and F) and for their secular variation (rate of change). These maps are available for download in pdf format by clicking on the browse images below or you can download a zip file containing all of the map pdfs with or without the blackout zones. Maps are available in Adobe PDF and Esri Shapefile format.
 The WMM consists of a degree and order 12 spherical-harmonic main (i.e., core-generated) field model of 168 spherical-harmonic Gauss coefficients and degree and order 12 spherical-harmonic Secular Variation (SV) (core-generated, slow temporal variation) field model. WMM2020 supersedes WMM2015 and WMM2015v2 and should replace these models in navigation systems. Also included with the model is computer software (available in C) for computing the magnetic field components X, Y, Z, F, D, I, and H in geodetic coordinates and their temporal variations. The spherical-harmonic expansions used to compute the magnetic field components are the same as the ones described in The US/UK World Magnetic Model for 2015–2020: Technical Report.
 Earth's magnetic field, as measured by a magnetic sensor on or above Earth's surface, is actually the sum of magnetic fields generated by a variety of sources. These fields are superimposed on each other and through inductive processes interact with each other. The most important are these geomagnetic fields:
 The observed magnetic field is a sum of contributions of the main field (varying in both time and space), the crustal field (varies spatially, but considered constant in time for the time-scales of the WMM), and the disturbance fields (varying in space and rapidly in time). Earth's main magnetic field dominates, accounting for over 95% of the field strength at Earth’s surface. Secular variation is the slow change in time of the main magnetic field. The WMM represents only the main geomagnetic field.
 To create an accurate magnetic field model, it is necessary to have vector component measurements with good global coverage and low noise levels. The European Space Agency's SWARM satellite mission is presently the most suitable magnetic observing system. Also available are ground observatory hourly mean data, although with poorer spatial coverage. The observatory data can provide valuable constraints on the time variations of the geomagnetic field.
 Compasses have been used for several thousand years to determine direction. They point in the direction of magnetic force at the user's location, and the direction it points is, more often than not, in a different direction than geographic north (toward the North Pole). A more precise direction is achieved by knowing the angle between them (magnetic declination). However, declination changes with location and time, and a geomagnetic model is often used to correct for it. Since the changes in geomagnetic fields are difficult to predict, timely model updates (every five years for the WMM) are required for navigational accuracy. The WMM satisfies all these criteria and is therefore widely used in navigation. Examples include, but are not limited to, ships, aircraft, and submarines. Aircraft and satellites commonly use magnetometer based attitude (roll and pitch) control.
 Why do we need magnetic navigation when the Global Position System (GPS) is readily available? GPS provides precise point location but only measures travel direction when in constant motion. A GPS receiver must collect several sets of latitude and longitude pairs to obtain direction. In addition, GPS signals may become blocked due to obstructions, adverse terrestrial and space weather, ionospheric conditions, or being underwater or underground. Hence, compasses complement GPS receivers to attain precise and immediate navigational headings for air, ground, and water-based systems. Electronic compasses and the WMM commonly co-exist in GPS receivers.
 Antennas (e.g. satellite dish television) and solar panels often need to be precisely oriented for maximum performance. The WMM's declination information for specific locations is often employed by companies to orient their products correctly.
 While the WMM is traditionally used for navigation, it is now acquiring new utilities in consumer electronic devices with built-in digital compasses. Many of the new generations of smartphones and digital cameras take advantage of the WMM to estimate bearing. The availability of low-cost, small, and energy efficient electronic compasses allow for magnetic direction in portable electronics to be commonplace. NOAA is providing support to application development engineers to port WMM to their devices. For example, WMM comes pre-installed in Android and iOS devices, thereby bringing its use to more than a billion devices around the world. NOAA/NCEI has developed an application called CrowdMag that allows users to collect their own magnetic field data using the magnetometers in their phone. This app sends data anonymously back to NOAA so it can be used to help validate and expand future magnetic models.
 Oil and mineral exploration companies use airborne and marine magnetic fields to detect magnetic signals from Earth's crust. These small amplitude signals (typically 100s of nT), must be separated from the large main magnetic field (typically 20,000 to 60,000 nT). Companies use geomagnetic models to extract these small magnetic signals from the survey records. A new application uses geomagnetic models for directional drilling. Oil wells are often drilled horizontally from a conveniently located platform. An electronic compass located behind the drill head (bit) provides the engineers with accurate orientation of the bit.
 The December 2021 State of the Geomagnetic Field report is now available. This report provides an assessment of the performance of the WMM2020 two years after its release, and describes noteworthy changes in the Earth's main magnetic field, including magnetic pole drifts and the deepening of the South Atlantic Anomaly.
 Changes of the fluid flow in Earth's outer core lead to unpredictable changes in Earth's magnetic field. Fortunately, the system has large inertia, so that these changes take place over time scales of many years. By surveying the field for a few years, one can precisely map the present field and its rate of change and then linearly extrapolate it out into the future. Provided that suitable satellite magnetic observations are available, the prediction of the WMM is highly accurate on its release date and then subsequently deteriorates towards the end of the five-year epoch, when it has to be updated with revised values of the model coefficients.
 It is important to recognize that the WMM and the charts produced from this model characterize only the long-wavelength portion of Earth's internal magnetic field, which is primarily generated in Earth's fluid outer core. The portions of the geomagnetic field generated by Earth's crust and upper mantle, and by the ionosphere and magnetosphere, are largely unrepresented in the WMM. Consequently, a magnetic sensor such as a compass or magnetometer may observe spatial and temporal magnetic anomalies when referenced to the WMM. In particular, certain local, regional, and temporal magnetic declination anomalies can exceed 10 degrees. Anomalies of this magnitude are not common but they do exist. Declination anomalies of the order of 3 or 4 degrees are not uncommon but are usually of small spatial extent. See the Enhanced Magnetic Model (EMM) for a model which includes crustal fields down to 50km wavelength.
 Based on the WMM military specification, we define “Blackout Zones” (BoZ) around the north and south magnetic poles where compass accuracy is highly degraded. The BoZ are defined as regions around the north and south magnetic poles where the horizontal intensity of Earth’s magnetic field (H) is less than 2000 nT. In BoZs, WMM declination values are inaccurate and compasses are unreliable.
 We additionally define a “Caution Zone” (2000 nT <= H < 6000 nT) around the BoZ, where caution must be exercised while using a compass. Compass accuracy may be degraded in this region. The blackout (unreliable) and caution zones are displayed in figures 2 and 3. The WMM online/offline software displays warnings when the user location is within these zones.
 The WMM2020 software and online calculator include an error model providing uncertainty estimates for every geomagnetic element (X, Y, Z, H, F, I and D) and every location at Earth's surface. This model is built upon the results of the error analysis (see the WMM2020 technical report, to be published in February 2020), while taking into account the geometrical relationships between the various components. It includes both the commission error (due to inaccuracies in model coefficients) and the omission error (due to missing contributions to the total geomagnetic field such as crustal and external fields). The error values (Table 1) may be interpreted as one standard deviation difference between a hypothetical measurement and the calculator result for a location.
 A global map of the magnetic declination error is provided in Fig. 3. As can be seen on this map, the error is lower at mid- to low-latitudes, while it is larger near the magnetic poles and in an area close to South Africa where the horizontal field is very low.\n 
 Based on the WMM2020 coefficients for 2020.0 the geomagnetic north pole is at 72.68°W longitude and 80.65°N latitude, and the geomagnetic south pole is at 107.32°E longitude and 80.65°S latitude. The axis of the dipole is currently inclined at 9.41° to Earth's rotation axis. The WMM can also be used to calculate dipole positions. These model dip poles are computed from all the Gauss coefficients using an iterative method. In 2020.0 the north dip pole computed from WMM2020 is located at longitude 164.04°E and latitude 86.50°N and the south dipole at longitude 135.88°E and latitude 64.07°S.
 Every year, the performance of the WMM is assessed by comparing it to a more recent main geomagnetic field model, and by comparing its secular variation with the actual secular variation observed at ground-based observatories and satellite-based geomagnetic virtual observatories (GVOs). The evolution of the WMM Blackout Zones and the validity of the WMM error model are also reviewed as part of this assessment. For more information, see the latest State of the Geomagnetic Field report.
 The World Magnetic Model coefficient file is named “WMM.COF”. Numerical values of the Gauss coefficients (g_nm, h_nm, g_dot_nm, h_dot_nm) at the base epoch; their corresponding predictive annual changes for the next five years; and their associated degrees and orders are provided in this file. For more details about the WMM Gauss coefficients, see section 1.2 of the WMM Technical report.
 WMM coefficients are written to this file in a specific format. If implemented correctly, then the WMM.COF file format is designed to update to a new WMM by replacing the old “WMM.COF” file with the new “WMM.COF” file, without needing to make any changes to the software. The “WMM.COF” file is an ASCII file with one header line, 90 lines of coefficients data and two terminating lines. Each line has 48 characters, ending with a carriage return and a linefeed (\\n\\r).
 WMM is valid for five years from the \Model Epoch\ parameter given in decimal years. The \Date of release\ of the model has no significance in magnetic field calculation and is U.S. style, MM/DD/YYYY.
