 A new report and map published by the U.S. Geological Survey provides critical insight to electric power grid operators across the northeastern United States in the event of a once-per-century magnetic superstorm.  ,
 Major metropolitan areas along the I-95 corridor – including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC – will benefit from the report’s geoelectrical hazard assessment, published in the journal Space Weather. ,
 “These new maps will allow states and utilities to better anticipate the threat and response to future magnetic storms across the northeast,” said Jim Reilly, director of the USGS. “They will prove useful for planning for future power-grid installations and will help utility companies develop strategies to mitigate blackouts and power system damage.”,
 Geomagnetic storms occasionally occur in the space environment surrounding the Earth due to the dynamic influence of the sun and the solar wind on the Earth’s geomagnetic field. On the Earth’s surface, magnetic storms can produce blackouts – for example, a storm in March 1989 caused a blackout of Quebec, Canada, and the northeastern United States. Even more concerning are the rare magnetic superstorms comparable to the “Carrington” storm of 1859, which today could cause blackouts on a continental scale and damage infrastructure that would not only be costly and time consuming to repair, but could potentially pose a threat to human safety.,
 The new USGS research shows that geological structure impacts the strength and direction of storm-generated geoelectric fields. In particular, USGS models show high geoelectric risk potential across the igneous and metamorphic rock of the Appalachian Mountains. In contrast, the sedimentary rock of Appalachian Plateau and Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain exhibits lower potential.,
 Submarine cables have become a vital component of modern infrastructure, but past submarine cable natural hazard studies have mostly focused on potential cable damage from landslides and tsunamis. A handful of studies examine the possibility of space weather effects in submarine cables. The main purpose of this study is to develop a computational model, using Python, of geomagnetic induction on submarine cables. The model is used to estimate the induced voltage in the submarine cables in response to geomagnetic disturbances. It also utilizes newly acquired knowledge from magnetotelluric studies and associated investigations of geomagnetically induced currents in power systems. We describe the Python-based software, its working principle, inputs/outputs based on synthetic geomagnetic field data, and compare its operational capabilities against analytical solutions. We present the results for different model inputs, and find: 1) the seawater layer acts as a shield in the induction process: the greater the ocean depth, the smaller the seafloor geoelectric field; and 2) the model is sensitive to the Ocean-Earth layered conductivity structure.,
 Geomagnetic perturbations (BGEO) related to magnetospheric ultralow frequency (ULF) waves induce electric fields within the conductive Earth—geoelectric fields (EGEO)—that in turn drive geomagnetically induced currents. Though numerous past studies have examined ULF wave BGEO from a space weather perspective, few studies have linked ULF waves with EGEO. Using recently available magnetotelluric impedance and EGEO measurements in the contiguous United States, we explore the relationship between ULF waves and EGEO. We use satellite, ground‐based radar, BGEO, and EGEO measurements in a case study of a plasmaspheric virtual resonance (PVR), demonstrating that the PVR EGEO has significant spatial variation in contrast to a relatively uniform BGEO, consistent with spatially varying Earth conductivity. We further show ULF wave EGEO measurements during two moderate storms of ∼1 V/km. We use both results to highlight the need for more research characterizing ULF wave EGEO.,
 Adjusted geomagnetic data are magnetometer measurements with provisional correction factors applied such that vector quantities are oriented in a local Cartesian frame in which the X axis points north, the Y axis points east, and the Z axis points down. These correction factors are determined from so-called absolute measurements, which are “ground truth” observations made in the field using specialized magnetometers and survey equipment that are (nearly) colocated with the automated and continuously running magnetic measurement instrumentation. Correction factors can be substantial, up to hundreds of nanoTeslas, depending on the geologic and geomagnetic characteristics of the observatory site. They also tend to evolve over time because of instrument response instability and changing site characteristics. Historically, correction factors were determined offline, up to 1 year or more post-measurement, and applied to raw measurements to produce “Definitive” data for scientific analysis. Growing demand for corrected real-time geomagnetic data to better support space weather operations motivated development of an “Adjusted” geomagnetic data product. Modern computational tools, and some notable practical concerns, dictated a transition to affine transformations in lieu of more traditional baseline corrections, as well as a calibration parameter estimation algorithm that is more robust and statistically optimal, and therefore better suited for automated and unsupervised execution. A theoretical basis for this algorithm is presented, along with a demonstration and validation based on a comparison of results obtained with traditional techniques. Discrepancies between Definitive corrected data and near real-time Adjusted data obtained using affine transformations are minimal, generally much less than 5 nanoTeslas per vector component, and less than 1 nanoTesla for the total field magnitude, which satisfies International Real-Time Magnetic Observatory Network (INTERMAGNET) standards.,
 Dynamic events on the Sun’s surface can affect the Earth and technological systems of importance to modern society. The charged particles of the solar wind interact with the geomagnetic field of the Earth’s surrounding space environment. Usually, this interaction is relatively subdued, but every once in a while the Sun emits a burst of solar wind that causes the temporary disturbance in the Earth’s magnetic field – a magnetic storm.,
 Magnetic storms can wreak havoc on the electric power grids and communication lines. In September of 1859, a magnetic superstorm caused widespread interference to telegraph systems, even sparking fires at some telegraph stations. In March of 1989, an intense magnetic storm caused a black-out across Québec; in November of 2001 another storm caused the failure of electrical power transmission in New Zealand; and yet another in October of 2003, called the Halloween storm, brought significant interference to the power-grid system in Sweden. Several studies, including one issued by the National Academy of Sciences, suggest that the future occurrence of a magnetic superstorm could cause widespread blackouts that would carry a significant economic cost.,
 A hazard is the probability that a dangerous natural phenomenon will occur in a given window of time, with a certain size, and in a given location. So, for example, a 100-year geoelectric hazard is the amplitude of the geoelectric field that is only attained or exceeded at a given location once per century on average. The 100-year geoelectric hazard level is the standard used by electric utility companies for investigating the resilience of their systems to the effects of rare, but very intense magnetic storms. Maps of 100-year geoelectric hazards assist utility company engineers as they examine which parts of distributed power-grid networks are more exposed, or, conversely, less exposed, to the deleterious effects of magnetic storms.,
 The geoelectric hazard at any particular location depends on both the regional intensity of geomagnetic activity and on the electrical conductivity of the surrounding rock and deeper Earth material. To create a geoelectric hazard map, research scientists of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Geomagnetism Program analyze historical records of magnetic storms acquired at long-running magnetic observatories, including those operated by the USGS across the continental United States. This analysis is then combined with magnetotelluric measurements of the relationship between geomagnetic activity and the induced geoelectric field, such as those that have been made at various geographic sites across the continental United States as part of the National Science Foundation’s EarthScope project.,
 Recently, Geomagnetism Program scientists have concentrated on regional mapping of geoelectric hazards across the Pacific Northwest and the Eastern United States. This work shows that geoelectric hazards maps are closely correlated with geologic structures. During a magnetic storm, conducting rock allow currents to flow in the Earth in response to a weak geoelectric field. These currents flow relatively easily through rock that is relatively electrically conductive, and less easily through rock that is relatively resistive. All of this means that, during a magnetic storm, electric currents, driven by geoelectric fields in the Earth, will tend to be diverted through electric power grids if they are situated atop the electrically resistive rock.,
 By integrating the geoelectric field induced during a magnetic storm along a power-grid line, one can estimate the voltage on the line. During an intense magnetic storm, hundreds, and even thousands, of volts can be generated on long power lines. These voltages are not the carefully controlled alternating voltages provided by generating stations, and, indeed, geomagnetically induced voltages can drive uncontrolled currents on power grids that are of sufficient strength to damage transformers. If many transformers are damaged, as might happen during a magnetic superstorm, the result could be prolonged loss of electric power across a broad region of the United States.,
 An important ongoing project of the USGS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is the real-time mapping of geoelectric fields across the continental United States. To accomplish this, real-time maps of the geomagnetic field, created using data from magnetic observatories, are combined with magnetotelluric survey measurements to estimate the time-varying geoelectric field. These geoelectric field maps will assist utility companies with their real-time operations – enabling the assessment of geoelectric hazards as they evolve over the course of a magnetic storm and helping power-grid managers to make decisions that may minimize the impact to their systems.,

 In 1722 and 1723 a London clockmaker, George Graham, observed daily and consistent variations on one of his instruments, a “Needle upon the Pin” (a compass), for which he had no explanation. Swedish scientists obtained some of Graham’s instruments to record what is now known to be the variations in Earth’s magnetic field. In 1741, they noticed a significant deflection of the compass needle during an aurora, thus connecting auroral phenomena with the Earth’s magnetic field for the first time.,
 Fast-forward 250 years. A new very sensitive seismometer, an instrument used to record earthquakes, was installed in 1991 at the Black Forest Observatory (BFO, Schiltach Germany). This was, and still is, one of the quietest locations in the world, with little outside noise that could contaminate the ground signals recorded by the seismometer. And yet… on February 21, 1994 a strong magnetic storm that was recorded on magnetometers throughout the planet was also recorded on the BFO seismometer. What follows is a story about an unusual marriage between instruments used to measure what’s above us (Earth’s magnetic field) and instruments used to measure what’s below us (earthquakes).,
 An aurora is a colorful light display in the night sky mostly in the polar regions caused by the interaction between the solar winds and particles in the magnetosphere. These events in turn, influence the geomagnetic field that exists in the Earth, which in turn influence the electrical currents in the Earth (and in our built electrical systems, see Keeping the Lights On in North America.) The study of geomagnetic storms is driven both by scientific curiosity and also by the need to understand and mitigate the risk they pose to electrical grids.,
 Aaron Lojewski, a local resident, was driving on a dark road near Fairbanks, Alaska on February 2, 2019 just after midnight when the sky “erupted” with mostly pink colors. He stopped his car and took a photograph that was published in the local newspaper. This auroral event was one of three that were used by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and University of Alaska, Fairbanks scientists in one of two studies on the unusual connection between auroras, magnetometers (instruments that measure the Earth’s geomagnetic field), and seismometers (instruments that record the ground shaking during earthquakes). The space physicists and the seismologists were brought together by two different goals that turned out to have the same solution: 1) there are very few magnetometers around the world—and especially in remote arctic Alaska—because a geomagnetic observatory is very expensive; but we need more, and 2) there are a large number of seismometers around the world, and some of them record geomagnetic storms that are considered “noise” that needs to be removed.,
 Although it is well known that the ferro-magnetic material used in seismometers is sensitive to magnetic fluctuations, the exact influence had not been carefully analyzed. Geomagnetic signals are in the low frequency range, so seismic instruments that record in the low frequency range sometimes have a shield around them to block out the geomagnetic signals. But the shields are expensive, so they were not used on the 193 Transportable Array (TA) seismic stations that are currently in Alaska. The TA provided an excellent opportunity to observe the geomagnetic signal (“noise”) on this dense network in a region where space weather events (auroras) are frequent.,
 In one study, analysis of the data from the magnetometer and the seismometer at the permanent Global Seismographic Network (GSN) COLA station near Fairbanks showed that using a relatively inexpensive magnetometer to record the geomagnetic signal and then removing that “noise” from the seismic signal dramatically improved the seismic data. This approach worked for magnetometers up to 100-200km from the seismic station; variations of the geomagnetic field were too different from the seismometer location beyond that distance to be usable. During a magnetic storm, the magnetic signal is so strong compared to the background seismic signal that it can be detected on the seismometer. The COLA station is part of a network of 150 permanent seismometers around the world used by the USGS to locate earthquakes.,
 In the second study, the scientists used 6 all-sky cameras in Alaska that record optical data, in other words, photos of auroras; 8 magnetometer stations (several at the same sites as the cameras) to monitor space weather activity; and more than 200 seismic stations from the temporary TA stations and the permanent regional network in Alaska operated by the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. They focused on data from auroras on 3 different dates. The three different types of instruments all recorded the activity from the auroras, and the use of data from multiple seismometers allowed the seismic signal and the geomagnetic signal to be separated, providing geomagnetic data from locations where there were only seismometers.,
 In addition to the ability to use seismometers and inexpensive magnetometers to increase the density of data collected for geomagnetic activity, the GSN stations have 3 extra unused communication channels that could be used to send the geomagnetic data back to the central processing system immediately, providing additional realtime data to monitor space weather that may be negatively affecting power grids.,
 The outcome of the two studies results in a win-win situation for both seismologists and space physicists. Adding a relatively cheap magnetometer to each Alaska seismic station would result in better seismic data for earthquakes and also more geomagnetic data in real time for monitoring space weather.,

 Solar flares and magnetic storms belong to a set of phenomena known collectively as \space weather\. Technological systems and the activities of modern civilization can be affected by changing space-weather conditions. However, it has never been demonstrated that there is a causal relationship between space weather and earthquakes. Indeed, over the course of the Sun's 11-year variable cycle, the occurrence of flares and magnetic storms waxes and wanes, but earthquakes occur without any such 11-year variability. Since earthquakes are driven by processes in the Earth's interior, they would occur even if solar flares and magnetic storms were to somehow cease occurring.,
 Electromagnetic variations have been observed after earthquakes, but despite decades of work, there is no convincing evidence of electromagnetic precursors to earthquakes. It is worth acknowledging that geophysicists would actually love to demonstrate the reality of such precursors, especially if they could be used for reliably predicting earthquakes!

 High altitude pilots and astronauts can experience higher levels of radiation during magnetic storms, but the hazard is due to the radiation, not the magnetic field itself. Geomagnetism can also impact the electrically based technology that we rely on, but it does not impact people themselves. ,
 Yes. There is evidence that some animals, like sea turtles and salmon, have the ability to sense the Earth's magnetic field (although probably not consciously) and to use this sense for navigation.,
 The mission of the U.S. Geological Survey's Geomagnetism Program is to monitor the Earth's magnetic field. Using ground-based observatories, the Program provides continuous records of magnetic field variations covering long timescales; disseminates magnetic data to various governmental, academic, and private institutions; and conducts research into the nature of geomagnetic variations for purposes
